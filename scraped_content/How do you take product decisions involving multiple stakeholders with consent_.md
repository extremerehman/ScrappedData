Here is how to answer it,



To make critical product decisions, that involve multiple stakeholders, we usually follow a well-known framework (called the SPADE framework).

S.P.A.D.E (created by Gokul Rajaram at Google and Jeff Kolovson at Square) -  



Setting - First, we start out by setting the context of the discussion. like What (decision needs to be taken), When (by when we will have to decide), and Why (does the decision matter) related to the product or its feature.People - Identify the key people or stakeholders for the discussion.Alternatives - Brainstorm and come up with a complete set of distinct and feasible solutions/alternatives with the stakeholders.Decide - Once all the alternatives are listed out, we make a complete pros and cons list for each of the alternatives and vote/decide based on that.Explain - Once decided, we document and communicate the details of the discussion (context of the problem, people involved, alternatives discussed, pros & cons list, and final decision taken) to all the stakeholders.

Setting - First, we start out by setting the context of the discussion. like What (decision needs to be taken), When (by when we will have to decide), and Why (does the decision matter) related to the product or its feature.

People - Identify the key people or stakeholders for the discussion.

Alternatives - Brainstorm and come up with a complete set of distinct and feasible solutions/alternatives with the stakeholders.

Decide - Once all the alternatives are listed out, we make a complete pros and cons list for each of the alternatives and vote/decide based on that.

Explain - Once decided, we document and communicate the details of the discussion (context of the problem, people involved, alternatives discussed, pros & cons list, and final decision taken) to all the stakeholders.

To add more, you can add an example to this. Like the last time you had to decide something which involved consent from multiple stakeholders and how did you go about coming to a decision and what was the result/impact of that decision on the product.
