### Ask Clarifying Questions:



Before beginning to answer a product A/B testing question, it is important to ask clarifying questions to gain a clear understanding of the context and goals of the test. Some of the key questions that can be asked include:

1. Channel Specificity: It may be helpful to ask if the tests need to be specific to a particular channel.
2. Target User: It may be important to ask if there is a specific user group that the tests should be focused on, such as teenagers, middle-aged adults, or seniors.
3. Motivation for Testing: Understanding the motivation behind the testing can be useful in determining the goals and desired outcomes. In this case, the motivation for Facebook conducting these tests is to continue building connections, which aligns with the company's mission.
4. Limitations: Asking about any limitations that may affect the tests, such as budget constraints, technology restrictions, or time restrictions, can help ensure that the answers are accurate and feasible. In this case, there are no limitations mentioned.

### Describe the Product:



Facebook is a leading social media platform that offers users a platform to share and express different aspects of their life. With its multiple features such as Messenger, Marketplace, Groups, Games, and Jobs, Facebook provides a comprehensive experience to users.

One of the primary purposes of Facebook is to connect users with their friends and family. The platform offers three main ways for users to find friends:

1. Search: This feature allows users to search for friends by typing their name into the search bar.
2. Find Friends: Facebook also offers a “Find Friends” feature that suggests friends based on the user’s contact information and mutual friends on Instagram.
3. Friend Requests: Users can also receive friend requests from other users, making it easy for them to expand their network of friends.

Search: This feature allows users to search for friends by typing their name into the search bar.

Friend Requests: Users can also receive friend requests from other users, making it easy for them to expand their network of friends.



### Goal:

The objective of Facebook is to encourage its users to expand their social network by adding more friends. In order to achieve this through A/B testing, I will be focusing on enhancing the "Find Friends" feature, which provides suggestions for potential friends. The aim is to simplify the process and make it easier for users to discover new connections.

### User Groups:

In order to determine which user group to focus on for an A/B testing question, it is important to understand the different user groups and their behavior on the platform. There are three main user groups: New User, Moderate User, and Power User.

1. New User: This group of users is new to the platform and has not engaged much with it yet. They do not have many friends and there is not much information available about them.
2. Moderate User: This group of users has established a set of friends but is not actively friending many people. They have a moderate level of engagement with the platform and there should be sufficient data to surface recommendations for friends.
3. Power User: This group of users is highly active on the platform and friending people all the time. They have a large number of friends and are highly engaged with the platform.

New User: This group of users is new to the platform and has not engaged much with it yet. They do not have many friends and there is not much information available about them.

Moderate User: This group of users has established a set of friends but is not actively friending many people. They have a moderate level of engagement with the platform and there should be sufficient data to surface recommendations for friends.

Power User: This group of users is highly active on the platform and friending people all the time. They have a large number of friends and are highly engaged with the platform.

In this case, it is recommended to focus on the Moderate User group, as they have enough friends to provide valuable data and insights, but are not as active as Power Users, making it easier to analyze their behavior and provide meaningful recommendations.
