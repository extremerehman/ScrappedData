Start by first asking some clarifying questions about the problem to the interviewer, then eventually as the discussion grows and based on the answers of the interviewer you will be able to reach some conclusions. 

Interview Tip -  Follow the CIRCLES Framework.

Q) Is this product we are envisioning exists within the Facebook app or outside it?

A) As you wish. You can put it within or outside it. The concept is it would be something that Facebook as a company would launch.



Next, outline the map of the interview (your approach) to the interviewer. It will demonstrate your ability to structured thinking.



Approach - 



Companies Mission and Strategy - How is it related to launching a Movie Product.Identifying the Customer Segments.Brainstorm about customer pain points and needs.Prioritize & come up with few Solutions.Evaluate the solutions on impact and other key metrics.Pick the best one and go through the MVP.

Identifying the Customer Segments.

Brainstorm about customer pain points and needs.

Prioritize & come up with few Solutions.

Evaluate the solutions on impact and other key metrics.

Pick the best one and go through the MVP.







Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.

Hence, it totally makes sense for Facebook to move into the movie’s space. Since it is something people from all over the world have been using to connect with friends, family, and social communities. 

Recently, Facebook has also made some big bets around videos like Facebook Watch makes Facebook home for entertainment. (Apart from the social use-case). Facebook-owned Instagram is also focusing more on video-specific content with its Reels, IGTV, and Stories features.There are some big competitors in this space like Netflix, Amazon Prime Videos, and YouTube. So, we need to think of something more unique and different.







There are 2 big segments - 

Content Creators.Professional Movie Creators. (Very Low user base)Professional Influencers. (Low user base)EveryDay Person. (Large user base)Content Viewers.High UsageLow Usage

After all the segments are listed, let’s now prioritize and focus on one customer segment that has a higher Scope (Potential Users) & Impact with lower Effort (if possible).

Based on, Scope and Impact we selected the Creator Segment - “Every day Person”. With this, we can add some Social Experience to the creative experience of making a movie (which is usually alone or a small team).

Scope - This segment has a larger user base with users who have created video content in the past and new users who haven’t tried it yet. 



Q) Why didn’t you pick the viewer segment?

A) Facebook already has a pretty good UI in terms of viewing with Facebook Watch along with some social features like reacting, commenting, and sharing. I think we can leverage that. So, I am trying to focus more on adding socialness on the creator’s side (which is not there now).







Write down a list of Pain Points that you think Creators are facing along with its Scope and Impact.

Here are some of the pain points - 

A lonely experience while creating movies. (Primary Pain Point with larger scope).Reaching a bigger audience. (Secondary Pain Point).Wondering if the idea/script is any good.Finding and Bringing in more skilled people in the team.

Reaching a bigger audience. (Secondary Pain Point).

Wondering if the idea/script is any good.

Finding and Bringing in more skilled people in the team.









Once decided which pain point to solve, Brainstorm, and come up with few solutions.

Some of the solutions can be,

Groups - Creating Creative Groups for Networking and Moral Support throughout the movie process. (Low Impact).Sneak Peek - A portal to get viewers early on in the movie creation process.Collaboration - Create a movie together through Facebook. This will add a social experience by working together, sharing moments, and building memories over time on Facebook. (High Impact)

Therefore, moving ahead with Collaboration. Next, we will list down some of the product features.







“Add shared video or stories to your movie” option given after posting a video or story.A separate entry point can be given on “Facebook Watch”.Tagging People in the project asking them to collaborate asynchronously.My Library to store published and draft/ongoing movies.Basic editing option (like crop)Publishing it as multiple chapters (a part of the whole movie).

“Add shared video or stories to your movie” option given after posting a video or story.

A separate entry point can be given on “Facebook Watch”.

Tagging People in the project asking them to collaborate asynchronously.

My Library to store published and draft/ongoing movies.

Basic editing option (like crop)

Publishing it as multiple chapters (a part of the whole movie).

Q) How will it be different than Youtube?

A) In YouTube you can only add a video, do some basic editing, and upload it. Whereas on Facebook, you can Tag other people, Collaborate with them asynchronously, add up small chunks, and finally build up to something over time. 







Q) What are some of the key issues that you are more worried about in this?



A) Privacy - People may be comfortable at the beginning but not everyone will be comfortable towards the end or later stage of their life.

B) Retention - Huge value to the user over the period and while posting it. But we want to keep them engaged over the period.







At Launch - Are people able to use this feature?

Later - Engagement around the actual post. So the list of metrics will look like this,

Click-Through Rate (CTR)The number of installments added per month.The average length of the installment (to decide the storage size).The average number of friends included in the creation process (as the idea is of collaborative creating)Retention - 2 months retention of the people who added something 2 months ago are they still adding something.
