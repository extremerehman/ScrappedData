[Guess estimate the Number of Mobile Phones Sold in India annually](https://mypminterview.substack.com/p/estimate-number-of-mobile-phones-sold-in-india)





#### Known:

1. The population of India ~ 1.3 Billion
2. Average time spent on Smartphones by Indians ~ 7 hours (link)
3. Smartphone penetration in India ~ 60%

The population of India ~ 1.3 Billion

Average time spent on Smartphones by Indians ~ 7 hours ([link](https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/dec/13/average-time-spent-on-smartphone-up-25-per-centto-69-hrs-amid-pandemic-report-2235704.html))

Smartphone penetration in India ~ 60%



#### Calculation -



Total number of smartphones users in India :

= (Smartphone penetration in India) x (Total Population of India)

= 60% of 1.3 Billion

~ 800 Million (approx)



Since we know the average time spent on Smartphones by Indians now stands at 7 hours daily (post-pandemic).



Therefore, the total number of hours spent on smartphones in a day,

= 7 x 800 million

= 5600 million hours per day.
