Product Estimation questions are frequently asked by interviewers in product management interviews, to check your ability to estimate metrics (such as revenue, cost, the number of users, etc.) of a product.

Guess-estimation becomes an important skill for a product manager when it comes to estimating the revenue of a product, the size of a new market, the cost of running a product, the revenue or growth potential of a new business opportunity and convincing stakeholders of a new product idea and its prioritization in the roadmap.

While answering, its important to

Communicate the estimation approach in a structured way while explaining.Make sure the interviewer is on the same page with your calculations and approach.Explain your assumptions and the rationale behind them.Use an estimation tree, it allows you to explain your operations' logic first, then focuses solely on calculations.

Communicate the estimation approach in a structured way while explaining.

Make sure the interviewer is on the same page with your calculations and approach.

Explain your assumptions and the rationale behind them.

Use an estimation tree, it allows you to explain your operations' logic first, then focuses solely on calculations.

Answer Structure:

Here is a step-by-step framework, you may follow while answering product estimation interview questions during your interview:

Ask clarifying questions to remove ambiguity and narrow the scope of the question.Make an equation. based on the assumptions, edge cases, and data sources.Break down the equation into components along with explaining your assumptions.Calculate each component to solve the equation and find the result.Do a sanity check of your equation, assumptions, and calculations.

Make an equation. based on the assumptions, edge cases, and data sources.

Break down the equation into components along with explaining your assumptions.

Calculate each component to solve the equation and find the result.

Do a sanity check of your equation, assumptions, and calculations.



Clarifications:

Q) Google has a number of services, Search, Youtube, Mail, etc? Assuming this is Google Search.A) YesQ) When you say Google are you saying Mobile or Desktop or both?A) BothQ) I am assuming we are considering only the Manual mode (via mobile, desktop, app, web, home device) of search and not robo/API based?A) YesQ) Geographically, are we looking at the global population?A) YesQ) The trend varies from hour to hour assuming you're asking on average on any given day.A) Yes

Analysis: 



We'll do a Top-Down approach.



Total Global Population = 7.5 Billion

Geographies to exclude: China, Half of Russia (people here don't use Google as their primary search engine)Assuming these geographies constitute 1.5 B people. = 7.5 B - 1.5 B = 6 B Only 50% of people are connected to the internet.  = 6 B - 3 B = 3 B leftGoogle market share with Bing, Yahoo, AOL, other regional engines: Let's assume it to be about 75%  = 75% of 3 B = 2.25 B

Geographies to exclude: China, Half of Russia (people here don't use Google as their primary search engine)Assuming these geographies constitute 1.5 B people. = 7.5 B - 1.5 B = 6 B 

Only 50% of people are connected to the internet.  = 6 B - 3 B = 3 B left

Google market share with Bing, Yahoo, AOL, other regional engines: Let's assume it to be about 75%  = 75% of 3 B = 2.25 B

Now, we are left with 2.2 Billion people who are potentially using Google search as their primary search.



Usage Frequency



We can segment them in their frequency of usage. I would say there are 3 types of searchers: 

Aggressive.Active.Passive.

Aggressive.

Active.

Passive.

Passive searchers are those who don't really use the internet to search on a daily basis (like old people, kids, our mom/dads, majority of the rural population). 

Assuming this type represents the majority, = 40% of 2.2 B = 0.88 B people.

Active people would search once a day. Assumed to be 30% of the population, = 660M people.

Aggressive searchers are super active searchers who might search 4-8 times a day. Assumed to be 30% of the total population, = 660M people.

 = 660*1 + 660*6

 = 4.6 B searches per day

 = 4.6B / 24 hours / 60 min / 60 sec

 = ~ 53,240 searches per second

For Sanity Check, We have assumed 2.2 B users use Google search with 4.6 B searches per day. This means, that 1 person makes an approx ~ 2 queries per day, and this guess seems to be within a good limit.
