The other day, I was trying to send a critical private message on Linkedin.

And because my phone notifications were disabled, as soon as I sent my message, Linkedin showed me this popup. . .



Especially compared to this notification permission request popup, that'd randomly appear when you log in.



The initial prompt is better due to the following four reasons,



Context: If a user has invested time in doing some activity, they would most likely want to get notified about the next trigger. In this case, since I have invested time in sending a message, I would want to get notified on receiving a response.  Micro-commitment: The concept of micro-commitment, where people feel more comfortable taking small, incremental steps that are in line with their previous actions, is a powerful motivator. By leveraging this idea, companies like LinkedIn can encourage users to engage with their platform in ways that feel less intimidating or overwhelming. For example, LinkedIn may use a contextual question, such as "Would you like to activate notifications for new job postings?" to encourage users to take a small action that is consistent with their prior activity on the site.While this may seem like a small detail, this first step can be incredibly crucial. For instance, reactivating iOS notifications after they have been disabled can be a significant ask. By framing the request in a way that feels manageable and non-threatening, LinkedIn is more likely to elicit a positive response from users. This, in turn, can lead to greater engagement and use of the platform, ultimately benefitting both the company and its users.Human: The emphasis of the prompt is on a particular instance of human interaction rather than solely on the product itself.Singularity Effect:The Singularity Effect suggests that individuals tend to care more about specific, identifiable people than abstract concepts or groups. In line with this phenomenon, LinkedIn has implemented a clever approach by displaying the name and profile picture of the person you just messaged, rather than using vague notifications such as "know when a connection answers."Value: The concept of value is centered on the advantages or benefits that I derive from a product or service (knowing when Bill Answers), rather than on abstract characteristics such as alerts, sounds, or badges.Conversational: In conversational settings, it is often more convenient to provide a straightforward "yes" or "no" response. Afterall, when was the last time you responded with the word "Allow" to a question posed to you in real life?

This feature is not only beneficial to me, but according to LinkedIn's product team, it also results in 5 times higher conversions compared to the default triggers.







Retaining users is heavily reliant on notifications. However, approximately 50% of users tend to block them.

Furthermore, when a user selects "Don't Allow" for a notification request on iOS, it becomes impossible to prompt them again. This makes it extremely challenging to re-engage with such users.

Nevertheless, by leveraging behavioural retention triggers, Linkedin has successfully attained a conversion rate of 5-10% (as compared to the 1-2% for random prompts) and can gradually rekindle user engagement by delivering the notifications they find valuable (and have requested).



These retention triggers can be customized to suit any type of product, whether it is B2B, B2C, mobile, desktop, etc.

For instance, let's take an example from Slack.

The key is to show your users that you understand that their attention is precious andthat you won't abuse it.

Retention Triggers Checklist:



4 Steps To Implement Retention Triggers,

1. Identify: Find the most important actions in your product(e.g., view report, send a message, upsell CTA).

2. Scope: Map out when they happen in your customers' journey. Pay close attention to what happens right before and after.

3. Ideate: Brainstorm 3 experiment ideas to make the prompts more timely, valuable & incremental for your customers.

4. Experiment: Run an experiment and compare your cohorts' conversions.

Checklist for Implementing Retention Triggers:



Implementing retention triggers can be a powerful way to improve customer engagement and retention for your product. Here are the four steps you can follow to implement retention triggers effectively:

Identify the most important actions in your product: Begin by identifying the most important actions that your customers take when using your product. These might include actions such as viewing a report, sending a message, or clicking on an upsell CTA. By focusing on these actions, you can identify the key triggers that will help to retain your customers.Scope out when these actions occur in your customers' journey: Once you have identified the most important actions in your product, map out when they occur in your customers' journey. Pay close attention to what happens right before and after these actions, as these are often the moments when customers are most receptive to retention triggers.Ideate and brainstorm experiment ideas: The next step is to brainstorm at least three experiment ideas to make the prompts more timely, valuable, and incremental for your customers. For example, you might experiment with personalized messaging, offering rewards or incentives for completing certain actions, or creating urgency around time-limited offers.Experiment and compare cohort conversions: Once you have your experiment ideas, it's time to run an experiment and compare your cohorts' conversions. Monitor the impact of your retention triggers and make adjustments as necessary to continue improving customer engagement and retention. By following these four steps, you can implement retention triggers that are tailored to your customers' needs and that help to drive long-term customer loyalty.

10 Tips for Effective Prompts That Enhance User Experience and Conversion



Focus on small steps: Use the power of micro-commitment and consistency to build trust gradually. Instead of overwhelming users with a lot of information, try to break down the prompt into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, a prompt such as "Would you like to know when Bills responds?" can make the unavoidable "open your iOS notifications settings" prompt that follows a lot less threatening.Timing is crucial: Use specific self-triggered prompts that are relevant to the user's context. These prompts tend to perform better than a tsunami of random requests. For instance, in Hopper's case study, the prompt "Can we access your location?" was timed perfectly and delivered when it was most relevant to the user, resulting in a significant improvement in conversion rates.Emphasize value: It's essential to make the value of your prompts obvious to your users. Rather than focusing on the feature, describe the benefits of the action to the user. For instance, Duolingo does an excellent job of this by highlighting the value of learning a new language and how it can benefit the user's career prospects. If you ask for any information or access, ensure that it is in exchange for clear value demonstrated upfront.Leverage the Singularity Effect: Whenever possible and relevant, try to frame the prompt in relation to an individual. This technique can help leverage the Singularity Effect and increase the chances of conversion. For example, using a prompt that says, "You're missing out on exclusive content" can help create a sense of urgency and make the user feel special.

Things to Avoid When Designing Notification Prompts:

Designing effective notification prompts is crucial to engaging and retaining your customers. However, there are several things you should avoid to ensure that your prompts are not confusing, overwhelming, random, tunnel-visioned, annoying, or unethical. Here are some of the things you should avoid when designing notification prompts:

Vague language: Avoid using confusing or vague language in your prompts. For example, the Audible prompt "Receive important account updates and stay inspired" is unclear and lacks specificity. Instead, use clear, concise language that clearly communicates the value of your notifications.Overwhelming content: Avoid using walls of text in your prompts. Your users should be able to understand the value of your notifications at a glance. If you need to use multiple paragraphs to explain the value of your notifications, it's probably not that valuable in the first place.Random timing: Don't prompt users without context. Timing is crucial, and you need to figure out the best entry point that resonates with your users. Blast notification prompts to users as soon as they log in is easy, but if the prompts are not related to what they came in for, you'll hardly get past 1-2% conversion rates.Tunnel-visioned approach: Using behavioural triggers and micro-commitments should not be limited to the user onboarding stage. You can use these principles for acquisition (email opt-ins on your website), activation (lifecycle emails), retention (in-app messaging), and even revenues (PQL/upsell call-to-actions). For example, when a user clicks "Don't allow" on a notification prompt, iOS doesn't allow you to notify them anymore. The same applies to your email drips. If someone unsubscribes, they are tough to reach. The key is to ask them in a way that maximizes long-term engagement and shows value.Annoying repetition: Use a cool-off period so that you don't show a behavioural trigger every time an eligible member takes action. This will allow you to prompt again eventually, without annoying your users with repetitive notifications.Unethical practices: Avoid unethical practices such as baiting users with a false promise and spamming them, abusing people's attention, or using confirm shaming (e.g., "Yes, enable notifications" vs. "No, I hate valuable insights"). Always prioritize ethical practices that prioritize the value of your customers' experience.

Vague language: Avoid using confusing or vague language in your prompts. For example, the Audible prompt "Receive important account updates and stay inspired" is unclear and lacks specificity. Instead, use clear, concise language that clearly communicates the value of your notifications.
