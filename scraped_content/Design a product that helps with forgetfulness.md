The primary responsibility of a product manager is to lead the vision, design, and development of a product. When a business decides to create a product, it is based on the recognition of a genuine customer need, one for which the customer is willing to pay. The product manager plays a crucial role in recognizing customer needs and steering the design and development of products that effectively address those needs.

This product design interview question assesses your comprehension of the process involved in transitioning from customer needs to product development. This process entails clearly defining the customer's identity and understanding what they aim to achieve. It also involves outlining various use case scenarios where the customer engages in activities related to the product, and subsequently, prioritizing the features to be developed.

### What is the interviewer looking for?

The interviewer is gauging your performance based on the following:

1. Can you offer insightful observations about the customer and their requirements?
2. Are you capable of presenting a variety of use case scenarios that cover different aspects?
3. Is your response well-organized and coherent, or does it deviate from the main topic?
4. Do your solutions delve beyond superficial suggestions, offering in-depth descriptions?
5. Can you introduce unique ideas that set you apart from other candidates?
6. Does your demeanor convey confidence and credibility? Would your guidance be compelling to engineers and product professionals?
