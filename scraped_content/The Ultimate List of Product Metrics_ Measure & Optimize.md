Acquisition metrics can include a range of different metrics such as cost per acquisition (CPA), conversion rate, click-through rate (CTR), customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and many more. These metrics provide valuable insights into the success of different marketing channels and tactics, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions to improve their marketing strategies and drive growth. Here are some examples of acquisition metrics:

2. Conversion rate: Conversion rate is the proportion of website visitors who complete a desired action, such as buying a product or filling out a form. It's determined by dividing the number of conversions by the total number of visitors, and then multiplying the result by 100%.
3. Click-through rate (CTR): CTR is a metric that measures the percentage of people who click on a link in an advertisement or email. It is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions and multiplying by 100%.
4. Cost per click (CPC): CPC is a metric used in pay-per-click (PPC) advertising campaigns to measure the cost associated with each click on an ad. Essentially, CPC is calculated by dividing the total cost of the campaign by the number of clicks received.

Essentially, ROI is calculated by subtracting the total cost of the campaign from the total revenue generated and then dividing the result by the total cost of the campaign. This figure is then multiplied by 100% to express the ROI as a percentage.
