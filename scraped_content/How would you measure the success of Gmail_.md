To start off in the right direction, you need to explain your understanding of the product – what does it do, who uses it, and how.

“Gmail is a free mailing service by google, it is the largest and most widely used email service in the world. From Gmail, user can write, send, receive, delete, save, search for emails; chat with other Google users using text, voice and video; and use the same Google ID to access other Google services such as Google Drive, Calendar, Photo, Map, YouTube, Chrome.

The main purpose of Gmail is to assist/help people to communicate/share their thoughts/views/opinions via emails. This helps people to connect, communicate and collaborate with each other thus bringing them closer to each other.

The different kinds of user groups using Gmail are as follows:

Business users.Casual users.

Business users.

Casual users.



We can further categorize these users also based on their usage as follows:

1) Power users: These are the kind of people that use Gmail very actively. Use it multiple times a day and very promptly read, reply, and compose emails.

2) Casual users: These are the kind of users that use Gmail multiple times a week.

3) Passive users: These are the kind of people that rarely use Gmail.

Some of the direct competitors of Gmail are: Apple Mail, Yahoo Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Rediffmail, Hotmail, etc.

Indirect competitors are: Whatsapp, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Zoom, etc.”

As Google has already reached very high user penetration, the most important goal for Gmail is to keep Google's users engaged so that they stay with Google's app and services ecosystem.

Hence, our main aim will be to increase/drive user engagement of Gmail and we will be measuring the success of Gmail regarding the user engagement metrics.

To measure Gmail's success, we can focus on the engagement metrics, such as

1. Avg Face time per month should be stable or increase over time. 

2. # of emails sent/read per day / week / month.

3. # of Active days in 30 days.

Metrics 1 is difficult to measure accurately, also it might be slow to detect the trend and use it to understand gmails success accurately.Metric 2: Email sent/read per day/week/month - If this metric goes down, which indicates Gmail is losing importance to the user.Metrics 3 has similar limitations as Metrics 1.

So for this question, we decided that we will be measuring the success of Gmail mobile app for users in the US across the user engagement metrics and we came up with a list of metrics which we prioritized and at the end came up with,

The # of emails sent/read per day/week/month per user as the success indicator using which we will track the success of Gmail across user engagement. 

We can also visualize the value of Gmail to Google by breaking users into buckets based on their monthly read/sent mails, and measure their corresponding total Google Apps usage (facetime), # of Google Services used, ARPU, and LTV.
