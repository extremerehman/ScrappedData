### Why are Product Design Questions asked?



Product design is an integral aspect of the product management process. It involves taking an idea and turning it into a fully-realized, usable product. In the product design process, product managers must consider a wide range of factors, including customer needs, technical requirements, and business goals.

One way for an interviewer to assess a candidate's ability to design products effectively is to ask product design interview questions. These questions are designed to help interviewers understand the candidate's thought process, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

1. One of the key things that product design interview questions evaluate is a candidate's ability to think structurally in an ambiguous environment. Product management often involves making decisions with incomplete information and understanding how to proceed despite uncertainty.
2. Another important aspect of product design is identifying pain points in the customer journey. This involves understanding customer needs and pinpointing areas where the current product or service falls short. Good product managers are able to listen to customer feedback and use it to inform product decisions.
3. Product design also requires creativity and imagination. Interviewers may ask questions that evaluate a candidate's ability to come up with new and innovative solutions to design problems.
4. Additionally, being able to estimate the required efforts, time, and costs that would be needed to implement a product design is a key factor in any product management interview.

### 1. Describe the Product

Netflix is a popular streaming service that provides users with access to a vast library of television shows and movies. Subscribers can watch their favorite content on a variety of internet-connected devices, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and laptops. The service can be used for entertainment, inspiration, and education, making it a versatile choice for all types of users.

One of the key features of Netflix is that subscribers can download TV shows and movies to their devices for offline viewing. This allows users to watch content even when they do not have internet access. The option to download content is available for iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices.

In terms of competition, Netflix faces challenges from a number of other streaming services, including Amazon Prime Video, Disney+Hotstar, Youtube TV, Paramount+, HBO Max, Hulu, and Showtime. These companies offer similar services, and subscribers can often find similar content on multiple platforms. However, Netflix's extensive library and reputation for producing original content sets it apart from the competition.

Overall, Netflix is a great option for those who want to watch TV shows and movies on demand. With a vast library of content, offline viewing capabilities, and the option to subscribe to different plans, it is an easy-to-use service that offers something for everyone.

### 3. Goal

Design Netflix for senior citizens who are over 60 years of age to increase their engagement in the platform.

An increase in engagement will also lead to an increase in paid subscriptions to the platform.



### 4. User Segments

1. Senior Citizens - working and living on their own.
2. Senior Citizens - retired and living on their own.
3. Senior Citizens - living with their partner and family.
4. Senior Citizens supported by caretakers.

Senior Citizens - working and living on their own.

Senior Citizens - retired and living on their own.

Senior Citizens - living with their partner and family.

Senior Citizens supported by caretakers.



### 5. Pick a persona

I would prioritize the senior citizens that are retired and living on their own as they would have a lot of free time to spend compared to those working and living with family.

Next, I would map out the user journey, list the pain points and prioritize the list of solutions.



### 6. User Journey

1. The user wants to watch a movie and they begin by searching for it on Google.
2. They click on a link that leads them to the Netflix website.
3. On the Netflix homepage, the user chooses their preferred language.
4. The user then proceeds to sign in to their Netflix account or create a new account if they don't have one.
5. They then select a subscription plan and make payment.
6. Once they have a subscription plan, the user then begins browsing or searching for relevant content.
7. They read the description of the content to make sure it is what they want to watch.
8. Once they find the content they want to watch, the user clicks on the play button and the video begins streaming.
9. After finishing or not finishing the movie, the user closes the website and may return to it again at a later time.
10. When the user returns to the website, they want to be reminded of which show they were watching and where they left off.
11. The user then resumes watching the show from where they left off.
