How do you manage conflicts in your team as a Product Manager?

Behavioral Interview Question - As a product manager, what sorts of conflicts do you face with the engineering team and how do you go about resolving it?

As a product manager, there are multiple conflicts you can get into with engineering. Some of them are:



1. Prioritization of features - Why this feature is prioritized higher than this? Isn't the deprioritized feature a critical customer ask?



2. Change in prioritization - Why this feature has been deprioritized now? Why didn't you did your background research better?



3. Timeline delivery of features - This is a huge effort, can't do it in such a short time.



4. Customer validation - The requirement spec and mockups hasn't been validated by customers. Go do the validation first.



5. Change requests (during feature development) - Why didn't you review the engineering spec closely? Why change in behavior now in the middle of development?



6. Detailing of requirements - There were not enough details of the requirement you listed. We interpreted the scope of the feature to be only this much!



7. Bug triaging/ scope  - Why do you think this bug needs to be fixed in this release only?  This bug is working as designed, your requirement spec mentions nothing about this scenario.



8. Documentation - PMs should be the ones providing the documentation. We have provided our inputs already.



All these conflicts need to be resolved amicably by taking engineering into confidence and sharing more customer and business insights with them. 









Let’s dig deep into how to approach these conflicts and how these conflicts can be resolved,



Collaborative Approach - In the collaborative style of resolving, all the members of the group get together and brainstorm all possible solutions for the given problem and then you evaluate and assess the pros and cons and take decisions that are in alignment with the Company / Business / Project goals.If disagreements arise,  you resolve it as a group in that room or if it's a very large group,  then you probably have to do it in smaller groups, you have to do it one on one. The idea would be to listen and provide every person an opportunity to feel connected, to express what they're thinking, to incorporate that feedback, adapt and learn.Accommodating Approach -  Here you're really emphasizing on agreements, but the items which are in dispute,  you decide to put that in the parking lot for now and then you revisit it after a certain cooldown period. Compromising Approach - In this case, both the parties decide to give up one thing that matters to them so that both parties feel that they are in it or they feel that they won.Escalation Approach - The last approach is the forcing or escalation approach where you're not able to make a decision so, therefore, you escalate it to powers above you, and they impose and force down a decision.

Each of these approaches has its own merits and demerits, and they're all tools in your toolkit that you can employ depending on the situation. There's no one right or wrong answer. Typically, I prefer the collaborative approach, but you do have to use all these different approaches depending on the situation that you are in.



Also, give an example of a similar situation,(Now use the STAR framework to give an example of a time when you had a conflict with one of your team member and what did you do about it as a Product Manager and what was the result)

Situation -Describe the context.Task -Describe your responsibilities in that situation.Action -Describe how you completed the task or endeavored to meet the challenge.Result -Finally, explain the outcomes or results generated by the action taken.



Talk face-to-face.No matter how heated the situation gets, stay calm.If someone is angry or has a complaint, first acknowledge their pain.Get to the core of the problem — break down the problem to find the root cause. Prioritize and start with the “easiest” challenge first.Recognize their efforts, share Praise with your teams and Celebrate success.
