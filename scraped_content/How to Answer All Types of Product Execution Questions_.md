How to structure your answer?



Here is one framework that can help you set goals:

Clarify: Ask the interviewer clarifying questions, if something is not clear.Product: Describe the product to the interviewer and check if you and the interviewer are on the same page.Product vision: Define it.Current state: Ask what is the current state, has the product achieved its original goals? What were they? Or confirm your understanding of the current state of the product with the interviewer.Short-term goals: Define and prioritize product metrics. Set measurable improvements of those metrics as short term goals.Long-term goals: List any obstacles or challenges that are in the way of achieving the product vision. For each obstacle or challenge, define an objective and a measurable result (OKR) that you want to achieve in order to eliminate it.

Clarify. Ask for clarification if you are unclear about what the interviewer is asking.List high-level reasons. Start by listing the high-level reasons, components, or user behaviors that are causing the problem.Gather context information. Ask questions to understand the context of the problem. For example, is the problem regional? Is the problem a one-time event or progressive?Discard issues outside of scope. If the answers to questions about context are outside the scope of Facebook Groups features, discard them.Establish a theory of probable cause. For each of the high-level reasons, components or behaviors you mentioned, recursively ask yourself why are these problems occurring, and list possible causes.Explain how to test your theory and fix the problem. Describe how you would test each probable cause. If possible, explain how you would resolve the problem.

Common Problems



Some common problems that you may be asked to diagnose are:

Falling revenue — could be caused by a lower price or a decline in sales.Falling profit — could be due to a drop in revenue or increase in cost.Falling sales — could be caused by customers buying less, customer churn, or decline in new customers.Declining new customers — could be due to lower traffic to the website, lower conversion rate.Increase in costs — could be caused by an increase in fixed and/or marginal costs, or increase in supplier prices, or distributor charging more.Decline in traffic — could be due to a decrease in new visitors, or decline in repeat visitors, or customers spending less time on the website (lower engagement).Decline in new visitors — could be caused by a decline in search traffic (e.g., the website has a lower ranking), direct traffic or referral traffic.

6. Pricing



What is this question about?

This interview question tests your knowledge and understanding of pricing strategies and how to apply them.

What is the interviewer looking for?

The interviewer is evaluating you on the following:

Do you start by identifying and analyzing different business issues that affect the price of a product (e.g., business goal, the state of the market, product differentiation, competitors, cost advantages, risks, other)?Can you formulate a pricing strategy that is supported by your previous analysis?Are you articulate and able to provide a structured answer?

Do you start by identifying and analyzing different business issues that affect the price of a product (e.g., business goal, the state of the market, product differentiation, competitors, cost advantages, risks, other)?

Can you formulate a pricing strategy that is supported by your previous analysis?

Are you articulate and able to provide a structured answer?



How to structure your answer?

Like other product questions, deciding on a pricing strategy starts with the business goal. Your business goal determines whether you will use an offensive or defensive pricing strategy. An offensive strategy looks to steal market share from the competition or eliminate it altogether while a defensive strategy looks to maintain your market leadership.

After defining the business goal, you need to think of other parameters that will influence how you will set a price and product/business activities you will need to put in place to support that pricing decision.

Below are the key parameters you need to keep in mind and how they can influence your pricing decision:

Business goal: Is the objective of setting a price to increase market share or profit or something else? A lower price increases market share, while a higher price increases profit.Differentiation: Is the product highly differentiated from competitors’ products or are they similar? Highly differentiated products can justify higher prices than competitors.Market evolution: Is the market still forming (emerging), have dominant players already emerged (growing and mature), or is the market already in decline? When the market is still forming, customers have not yet formed an opinion of the products. Therefore companies can set prices based on value perception; once dominant players have formed, pricing will depend on the business goals and product differentiation.Cost advantage: Does the company have cost advantages over competitors? Without cost advantages, a company cannot compete by continuing to lower prices, because this would just continue to erode profits.Risks: What are the risks of your pricing strategy? How are competitors going to respond? Can the company sustain lower prices? Can the company continue supporting its differentiation to justify premium prices?

Below is a suggested structure on how to answer a pricing question:

Define a business goal the company wants to achieve when pricing a product.Describe the state of the market: how are competitors pricing their products and what is their business goal?Describe the differentiation between the competitive products and yours, if there is one.State what your strategy would be for pricing to achieve the business goal. Some possible strategies are: offensive and defensive.Come up with a price or price range and explain your logic at arriving at that price.Comment on possible risks.Wrap up

Offensive Strategies



Be the price leader—when the market is mature, there are fewer differentiations, and you decide whether to compete solely on price (mature market).Price low to penetrate and grow market share (growing market).Price below cost to discourage competition (growing market).Compete by price/performance ratio (growing to mature market).Use promotional discounts to accelerate purchases (growing to mature market).

Defensive Strategies



Use price to segment the market.Use premium pricing (skim the market) to maximize profit.Use value-based pricing to price at the highest customer perceived value (only works when there are no competitors yet or when the product is highly differentiated).Use bait-and-switch pricing to draw attention to a lower price offering and later upgrade customers to a higher priced offering.
