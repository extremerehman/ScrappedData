Start by first asking some clarifying questions about the problem to the interviewer, then eventually as the discussion grows and based on the answers of the interviewer you will be able to reach some conclusions. 



Here you go - 

What is the definition of “Cancel” - Who is canceling it? Driver Cancel?Rider Cancel?Some Admin is canceling from backend?A) Assuming the cancelation is from the driver's side.Is rider cancel metric deviating in any way? (Assuming No)Has the definition of the ‘cancel’ metric changed before this decrease happened? Or are we logging the metric it differently now? (Assuming No)Which stage of the funnel is the cancellation happening the most? (From `driver app opening` to `accepting the ride` to `reaching at the pickup point` to `reaching the destination`)A) Assuming the cancellation happening the most near the driver ‘accepting the ride’ stage.Was it a gradual increase over time or a sudden increase? Or what is the time period of this increase?A) Assuming a sudden increase.Any particular regions that are affected? Like, Is it distributed uniformly across the country or in a certain proportion in some regions?A) Assuming a uniform increase across all regions.Were there any local holidays in those regions? (Assuming No)Which Andriod and IOS app version did we see this metric changes the most? Is it high towards the older versions?A) Assuming No. Requests were canceled uniformly across app versions.Any release that happened recently from the tech side?A) Assuming no tech deployment related to cancelation.Any new experience that we launched recently that is creating any confusion?  (UI design change/ icon change/ color change etc.) (Assuming No)Any issue reported by the drivers or the users regarding the cancellation of rides?  (Assuming No)Is there any connectivity issue reported in some regions? (Assuming No)Is the distance/time from the driver to the pickup point longer than usual in that region? (Assuming No)Is there an increase or decrease in the number of drivers on the platform? Are we seeing this cancellation more towards the new drivers or the old drivers? (Assuming No)Did anything come up on the news or strike or public sentiments that might be causing this? (Assuming No)Any increase in passengers calling drivers? (Assuming No)Can we know which segment of the drivers is canceling more? Drivers, who are only on one ride-sharing app (e.g Uber)?Drivers, who are on multiple ride-sharing apps (Uber, Ola, Lyft)?A) Assuming the cancellations are more in the segment of drivers who are on multiple ride-sharing apps. Did any competitor launch or made an announcement to launch some lucrative for the drivers? Or are they doing some special marketing campaign to incentivize drivers to pick their rides over ours?A) Yes, turns out one competitor is actually pushing incentivized notifications at the exact moments when a driver leaves the competitors app and at particular times throughout the day to bring the drivers back to their platform. Hence, after a driver accepts a ride on our platform and gets the incentivized notifications from our competitor, they cancel their current ride and switch to the competitor’s app.

Great! You found the problem. Congratulations!

Now, How would you fix it?The company's goal is to provide reliable transportation to its customers and cancelations are bad user experiences hence we want to minimize those.

We also need to check that the drivers are getting paid well (as per market standards) and also having a good experience.

Some of the steps that we could take are - 

Increase incentives to match our competitors.Change policy - Multiple and repetitive cancellations after committing to a ride can eventually ban a driver from using the platform again. (Driver numbers will get a hit so, might run a few A/B tests before that).
