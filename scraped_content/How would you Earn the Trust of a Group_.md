Most interviewers do not like stories where a candidate lost the group’s trust by making a mistake and earned it back by apologizing. Some may appreciate a good apology story, but most prefer that candidates not make mistakes in the first place. The same goes for stories where a candidate loses a group’s trust by lying, gossiping or playing office politics. Most interviewers prefer that the candidate not do those things period.

When I started as PM for my current company, I inherited a project with an upset partner team in Madrid. The US team wanted to make some changes to the user experience because the product was originally successful in the US. However, American users tend to have a different user experience when compared to Spanish users. The Madrid team didn’t trust us because they never worked with us before. 

To influence my Spanish counterparts to cooperate, I wrote a report for them. The report included: 

Analysis of metrics they felt were important, based on their target goals Suggestions for new UX improvements Estimated impact of those UX improvements Citations and inspirational sources for my UX suggestions 

Analysis of metrics they felt were important, based on their target goals 

Suggestions for new UX improvements 

Estimated impact of those UX improvements 

Citations and inspirational sources for my UX suggestions 

The report was very thorough, and the Madrid team loved it. Obviously, they weren’t going to trust me based on a report alone, so I sat down with the product manager in Madrid and reviewed, line-by-line, what features and improvements we should do. In the end, we decided to soft launch the product with a few additions. We decided that we could always make additional changes after the soft launch, as needed. 

We started to implement the changes that I proposed. I made sure to show commitment by being responsive and apolitical. I also worked hard and tried to be accommodating. When they visited our offices, I offered to take them to dinner and show them around town when other colleagues preferred to go home to rest and relax. 

After two to three months of working together, the product changed radically for the better. I had earned their trust, and in turn, they trusted my process and judgment. The pinnacle happened when my company awarded the Madrid partner team and me the Internal Excellence Award; it included a $5,000 cash bonus for each team member.
