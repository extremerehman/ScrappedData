Now, let’s get started with the solution - 

Interview Tip: Always remember to follow the framework





You: “Before I move ahead, I have a few clarifying questions I want to ask. Shall I proceed?”

Hiring Manager - “Sure.”



Are there any constraints in terms of cost, time, or effort?A) Yes, the solution should be cost-effective.Is this ATM launch for any particular region or will it be used worldwide?A) Consider this ATM is to be designed for the people in the US.Can I assume this ATM will be used by people greater than 18 years old?  (and not by children)A) Yes. Can I assume this ATM will be used by people who know English? (since most people in US, knows English)A) Yes.

There are 3 key objectives of using an ATM,

Dispense paper currency.Get/Modify the information.Submit cash/cheque.

Dispense paper currency.

Get/Modify the information.

Submit cash/cheque.



There are majorly 2 user groups,

Partially blind — can still see bold letters and primary colorsCompletely blind — cannot see anything

Partially blind — can still see bold letters and primary colors

Completely blind — cannot see anything



Prioritized User Groups:

Designing an ATM for Completely blinds should work for partially blinds too.



Taking a moment to think about the user journey of the selected user group.i.e completely blind,

Which is the nearest ATM for specially-abled?How to commute to the nearest ATM (uber, human guide, public transport, etc)Be sure about carrying the right ATM card (other lookalike cards like a credit card, metro card, etc might cause confusion)Want to feel safe and be independent and act fast to avoid transaction’s session timeout while operating ATMWant to feel confident if the dispensed cash amount matches the requirementHow to commute away safely from ATM (in case of carrying paper currency)

Which is the nearest ATM for specially-abled?

How to commute to the nearest ATM (uber, human guide, public transport, etc)

Be sure about carrying the right ATM card (other lookalike cards like a credit card, metro card, etc might cause confusion)

Want to feel safe and be independent and act fast to avoid transaction’s session timeout while operating ATM

Want to feel confident if the dispensed cash amount matches the requirement

How to commute away safely from ATM (in case of carrying paper currency)

Prioritizing the pain points:

Assuming, the user manages to reach ATM, we will work on pain points while dealing with the ATM.

Prioritized pain points:

Use the right ATM card.Feel safe and independent while operating ATM.Feel confident if the dispensed cash amount matches the requirement.

Use the right ATM card.

Feel safe and independent while operating ATM.

Feel confident if the dispensed cash amount matches the requirement.





For problem — How to use the right ATM cardSolution(s):

Attaching a unique count of bumps on the ATM card can help it distinguish from other look-alike cardsBrailled ATM cards can be issued by the respective bank.

For problem — Feel safe and independent while operating ATMSolution(s):

Have image recognition enabled systems in the ATM cabin that alerts in case there is more than 1 person in the room.The  ATM can be equipped with voice recognition and speaker capabilities which guide the customer on each step of the transaction. A headphone can be used for personalized and secretive step-by-step instructions.Brailled ATM keypad can be used alongside audio instructions to aid the customerFacial  recognition and/or biometric scan be used to identify the right  customer by the ATM and thus provide speedy and safe transactions

Facial  recognition and/or biometric scan be used to identify the right  customer by the ATM and thus provide speedy and safe transactions

For problem — Feel confident if ATM dispensed the right amount of paper currencySolution(s):

Brailled currency notes can help the customer identify the paper currencyThe ATM can notify the breakup of dispensed cash via audio. (like 10 bills of 500, 2 bills of 2000)

Brailled currency notes can help the customer identify the paper currency

The ATM can notify the breakup of dispensed cash via audio. (like 10 bills of 500, 2 bills of 2000)



Out of the above-listed solutions, we will focus and prioritize the solutions on two factors — cost and impact.

ATM equipped with voice recognition and speaker capabilities which guide the customer on each step of the transaction and also notify the breakup of dispensed cash.Impact - High, Cost - MediumBrailled ATM Keypad and ATM CardsImpact - High, Cost - LowImage recognition enabled systems in the ATM cabin that alerts in case there is more than 1 person in the roomImpact - Medium, Cost - HighFacial recognition and/or biometric scan be used to identify the right customer.Impact - Medium, Cost - High

ATM equipped with voice recognition and speaker capabilities which guide the customer on each step of the transaction and also notify the breakup of dispensed cash.Impact - High, Cost - Medium

Brailled ATM Keypad and ATM CardsImpact - High, Cost - Low

Image recognition enabled systems in the ATM cabin that alerts in case there is more than 1 person in the roomImpact - Medium, Cost - High

Facial recognition and/or biometric scan be used to identify the right customer.Impact - Medium, Cost - High



Based on the above criteria, we will pick solutions #1 and #2 which are cost-efficient and provide a high impact on customer experience





No. of successful transactions per customer - Month on Month.No. of successful transactions per customer in the specially designed ATM.No of new customers using the specially designed ATM - Month on Month.

No. of successful transactions per customer - Month on Month.

No. of successful transactions per customer in the specially designed ATM.

No of new customers using the specially designed ATM - Month on Month.







To summarize, we decided on the goal to increase retention and engagement for visually impaired ATM users. I would choose to solve the pain points where users are unable to independently operate an ATM by themselves.

To address the pain points,  I would build an ATM equipped with voice recognition and speaker capabilities that guide the customer on each step of the transaction and also notify the breakup of dispensed cash. Along with that to help users with identifying the right keys and cards, I would design Brailled ATM Keypad and ATM Cards. I would also measure the success of these features by tracking the usage and transaction rate from these ATMs.
