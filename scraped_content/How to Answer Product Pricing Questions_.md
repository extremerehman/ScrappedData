Product pricing questions assess your ability to evaluate the market of a new product, to price it properly, and to turn it into a business operation that generates the expected revenue given the company objectives and budget constraints.   





How you can answer a Product Pricing question?



Here is a step by step guide/framework, you should follow while answering product pricing interview questions: 

Ask clarification QuestionsDescribe the Product & the IndustryChoose an ObjectiveChoose a StrategySuggest a Price for the ProductProvide a Summary

Ask clarification Questions

Describe the Product & the Industry

Choose an Objective

Choose a Strategy

Suggest a Price for the Product

Provide a Summary



Now, let’s go through each of the above points and understand them in detail with an example,





The clarification questions will help you narrow down the scope of the interview. You can ask questions about where in the product life cycle the product is, whether or not the company has selected an objective with pricing (e.g. generating profit vs covering costs vs grabbing market share), how the competitors are doing in terms of business strategy, pricing, etc.

The interviewer’s answers to your questions can give you valuable direction. The interviewer might tell you about historical data that helps you understand how the market has reacted to the previous company pricing strategies. Or that they have decided to focus on a particular objective such as growing the user base for the company.

Let’s assume that the interviewer had asked you “How would you price Dropbox?”. You can ask a few questions such as: 

“Are there any information about how Dropbox has priced its product recently?” “Do you have any information around how the competitors are pricing their products?”“Is there any particular objective you’d like me to keep in mind?”“Is there a particular user segment you’d like me to price the product for?”

“Are there any information about how Dropbox has priced its product recently?” 

“Do you have any information around how the competitors are pricing their products?”

“Is there any particular objective you’d like me to keep in mind?”

“Is there a particular user segment you’d like me to price the product for?”

 These questions might give some hint about the direction of your answer but if the interviewer doesn’t provide any specific answers and suggests that you can make your own assumptions, you can jump to the next step.  



Provide your understanding of the product and the market that it is in. If you don’t know about some aspects of the product, you can make assumptions and explain your reasoning behind each assumption. There are  a few things that you can discuss here: 

What the product does, its user groups, product status in the product life cycleCompany’s current status and objective (e.g. focus on grabbing market share) Company’s financial status and cost structure (Does it have the resources to fund growth? Does it need to be profitable? etc) The competitive landscape Any competitive advantages (e.g. cost structure, distribution channel, talent, market share, partnerships)Market characteristics (e.g. growing, mature, competitive) 

What the product does, its user groups, product status in the product life cycle

Company’s current status and objective (e.g. focus on grabbing market share) 

Company’s financial status and cost structure (Does it have the resources to fund growth? Does it need to be profitable? etc) 

The competitive landscape 

Any competitive advantages (e.g. cost structure, distribution channel, talent, market share, partnerships)

Market characteristics (e.g. growing, mature, competitive) 

There are a few frameworks that you can use to structure your analysis of the product and the company. One popular framework is the  SWOT (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats). Another one is Porter’s five forces. It is not necessary for you to follow a  particular framework to analyze the product, company, and market.  You just need to provide a holistic overview of the product and business from various key perspectives to the business.  

The information you provide here is very important and guides you to choose the appropriate objective for your pricing strategy in the next step. 

In our Dropbox example, you can explain the Dropbox business briefly and say that it has two main user groups - consumers and enterprise. And for the purpose of this interview, you are going to focus on the enterprise pricing since most of the revenue opportunity is in the enterprise market (given consumers are used to receiving free storage services). And within the enterprise market, there are also different segments of clients. Larger clients will require case by case review of the client and custom pricing and for that reason, you are going to focus on enterprise clients that have less than 100 employees.  

And you can also describe the use cases that you think will be relevant to these clients. Examples are file storage, documents storage, the signature of files, exchange of documents between companies, etc. You can also describe the competitive landscape and mention that while in the enterprise market, Google Drive is their competitor, Dropbox has one key advantage (brand recognition in data storage, 256 encryption of data, owning e-sign software HelloSign) over Google Drive. And Box.net  is another company that is focused on the enterprise market. You can also describe the unique characteristics of Google Drive (its deep integration with Google products, easy access, etc) and Box.net  (enterprise focus, integration with many third-party services, etc).  

Your pricing objective helps you be strategic with your pricing and choose a path that aims at achieving a pre-defined goal. Your pricing model changes depending on the objective that you have selected for your pricing. For example, if your objective is to grab market share as fast as possible, it makes sense to price your product at a cost. And if you have the financial resources, you might even price it below cost. But if your objective is to make a profit, you will have to offer a price that generates profit after your company expenses. Here is a list of a  few sample objectives you can consider for your product:

Gaining market shareStaying competitive against competitorsGenerating profitGrowing as fast as possibleStarting relationshipMaximizing profit

Gaining market share

Staying competitive against competitors

Generating profit

Growing as fast as possible

Starting relationship

Maximizing profit

You must choose an objective that is relevant to the state of the company and the product. Make sure to provide some description around why you have chosen that particular objective.

For the Dropbox example, you can describe your objective to be  “grabbing market share” and that given many companies are in the process of moving their storage to the cloud, you believe that the market of online storage will grow significantly over time and there will be value-added services such as integration with third-party services, more storage, and access to more members of the company which create additional revenue opportunities. 

There are various pricing strategies that one can think of. Here are a few pricing strategies that you can consider:



Cost-based pricing: This is where you are analyzing the cost structure of producing your product and set up a price that helps you cover your expenses.Alternative-based pricing: You determine the client’s current cost of meeting their needs using methods other than using your product and determine a product price that is competitive against their alternatives. For example, if you are pricing an uber ride using alternative-based pricing, the maximum you can charge is the taxi fare for the same ride.Competitive pricing: You review your competitors’ pricing and price your product in a way that either beats them or is equal to them  (depending on your strategy).Perceived value pricing: Your price is determined by the perceived value of your product. For example, if your product is a blog, the price of the blog content cannot be high even if it creates a lot of value to users. This is because users associate blog posts with low perceived value. Sometimes a product delivers a lot of value but the perceived value is so insignificant that it's hard to charge a reasonable price to generate profit.Premium Pricing: This is when you decide to focus on a particular segment of the market and would like to send a clear signal to the market and inform them that you would like to charge a premium for your product.Price Leader: Offering the lowest price in the market to be known as the best price in the market.Low Starting Price: This is more suitable for products that require high setup costs (e.g. marketing automation software that needs integration with third-party services and needs to be connected to third-party services).

Low Starting Price: This is more suitable for products that require high setup costs (e.g. marketing automation software that needs integration with third-party services and needs to be connected to third-party services).

Here, you can either directly choose one particular pricing strategy and explain your reasoning behind that strategy or briefly go over a  couple of pricing strategy options and explain why you’d like to go with the particular pricing strategy that you have selected to achieve your objective.

In some cases, after you select your pricing strategy, you will have to go one level deeper and determine the various components of your pricing strategy. This part usually applies to enterprise products but it is helpful to keep it in mind. An enterprise service pricing  generally consists of various pricing components that you must cover:

Service Fee (monthly or annual)Activation Fee (one time) Marginal Price per unit of service (e.g. support hours)

Service Fee (monthly or annual)

Activation Fee (one time) 

Marginal Price per unit of service (e.g. support hours)

Some questions end here and the interviewers do not expect you to come up with the actual price of the product (e.g. What should be  Netflix pricing strategy?), but in most cases, you are expected to come up with the prices. The next step describes how you can come up with a  price for a product. 

For our Dropbox example,  you can explain that given your objective is to grab as much market share as possible, you’d like to go with the strategy of “pricing at cost for small teams” because this strategy makes you attractive to small and new companies, allows you to control your burn rate and improve your margins overtime via operation efficiency, the addition of new employees, and Moore’s law, where the cost of storage is halved every 18 months. This strategy allows you to lock down the relationships now and take advantage of your good storage cost structure (given the economies of scale for cost storage) as a  competitive edge. 

Now that you know your objective and pricing strategy that you have decided to move ahead with, you can suggest prices for the product. This step might require you to make assumptions about the cost structure,  competitive pricing, market size, etc.

For our Dropbox example, you can explain that you think the monthly cost per GB of data is $0.01 (clarify that this is an assumption and ask the interviewer if they are ok with your assumption). You can also explain that you are going to assume that your average client under 100  employees will have 20 employers (given there are usually few larger companies than smaller companies) and each member of the 20 person company will need around 100GB of storage. And if you add this all together, you can assume that your client will need around 2TB of storage. For a 2 TB storage, the cost of the storage will be 2,000 x  $0.01 = $20. And if we assume that the storage cost is 50% of the company expenses, we can assume that a break-even price for an average enterprise client with 2TB storage is $40.  

You can explain that your goal is to break even on companies with 3  employees therefore as long as the cost of 3 users is $40, we are breaking even. So, your suggested price will be $13 per month per user for a 2TB enterprise package. And your additional revenue and profit will be generated from value-added services and additional employees that get added to the client.

In the summary, you want to briefly describe the objective you selected, the strategy you have chosen to focus on to achieve your objective, and your suggested pricing.
