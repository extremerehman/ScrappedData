I divide the answer into 2 parts,

I explain why I'm interested in a particular industry that the company is in.I explain why I'm interested in that particular company.

I explain why I'm interested in a particular industry that the company is in.

I explain why I'm interested in that particular company.



Note: In the case of companies like Google and Facebook it's not necessary for you to talk about why you're interested in the industry because these companies are pretty much dominating the whole industry that they're in and you can just jump into why you're interested in that company. 

The reason for being interested in a particular industry is usually personal and it could be your education, your career path, your personal interests, and other things but make sure that you know why you're interested in a particular industry.

A sample answer that I would have given, “I've been a PM in the fintech space because I actually find there's an unlimited number of opportunities in the fintech space everywhere you look there's an opportunity for disruption there are a lot of complex systems that are outdated and it just sparks my interest, especially with my tech and entrepreneurial background and I, feel like I'll never get bored and there will be always something interesting for me to do or learn.”

The next thing you want to talk about is why you want to work in that particular company. 

I think it's a good idea to start talking about the company's strategy from a product's perspective, you can explain what you like about the particular problem they're solving or how they're the leader in the space and you want to be part of that the best team in the space or you can talk about how you like their product and their technology that they build.

Next, you can talk about the company culture (this is optional in some cases) but let's say you know for google and Facebook they do have slightly different cultures and you know Facebook has a stronger focus on data analytics and moving fast and this is something that you can highlight by saying you like to be in an environment where things move much faster and you think that Facebook can offer that to you.

One thing that I suggest is to make sure that you avoid saying things like I want to be here because I want to learn such and such things. 

I think the reality is that the employer is not hiring you so that you can learn something, they're hiring you to work for them, and when you say you're there to learn it probably means you don't know how to do that a particular task so I would word this in a slightly different way and I would say something like your culture or your product development process or your product development tools resonate more with me and my way of doing things and that's why I want to be here. 

Few more tips:

Spend less than 2 minutes answering it.

Spend less than 2 minutes answering it.

Make sure you really understand the industry and the company really well so you can speak very specifically about what resonates with you as a product manager. I would suggest writing down the answer and practice it a few times before the interview.
