### Why are Estimation Questions asked?



Estimation questions are often asked during interviews to assess a candidate's ability to think quantitatively and solve problems. These questions are designed to evaluate the candidate's ability to make quick calculations and come up with reasonable estimates for various scenarios. This may include:

* Assessing the size of an opportunity: Interviewers may ask a candidate to estimate the potential revenue or market size of a product or service. This can help the interviewer understand the candidate's ability to think strategically and assess market potential.
* Evaluating the potential impact of a project: Interviewers may ask a candidate to estimate the potential impact of a project on the company's bottom line. This can help the interviewer understand the candidate's ability to think critically and assess the long-term consequences of a project.
* Determining the cost of a project: Interviewers may ask a candidate to estimate the cost of a project, including the cost of materials, labor, and any other expenses. This can help the interviewer understand the candidate's ability to think financially and make budget estimates.

Additionally, it's crucial for the candidate to inquire if their assumptions are on the right track and seek the interviewer's feedback.
