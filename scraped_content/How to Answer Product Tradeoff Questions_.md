Take the bigger picture into consideration when making tactical decisions.

Communicate effectively the logic behind your decision.



Tradeoff interview questions are similar to Technical and Product Strategy interview questions in the sense that you will have to identify the attributes involved in your decision-making process prior to making the final recommendation.





Types of Tradeoff Interview Questions:



There are two types of tradeoff interview questions that you should be ready to answer.



The first type is where the interviewer asks you to describe the tradeoffs with a particular product design or product improvement idea that you have suggested. The expectation here is to see that you have thought about various edge cases and any potential challenges with your idea. Your job at this point is to be thorough in thinking about what can make an idea fail.Think of your answer to this tradeoff question as a disclaimer you are giving to the interviewer as well as an opportunity to demonstrate that you understand the potential downsides of your idea. It will show them that you have a good understanding of your objective. You can read more about how to cover the tradeoffs associated with your product design and product improvement in the Product Design and Product Improvement interview guides.

The second type of tradeoff question is where the whole interview session is about analyzing the tradeoffs associated with a couple of product direction choices. In this case, the interviewer will describe a  scenario to you and give you two options. The interviewer will then ask you to determine how you’ll go about determining which one is the right choice.

How to Answer Tradeoff Interview Questions?



Here is a step by step guide/framework, you should follow while answering Tradeoff interview questions: 



Your first task is to get a clear understanding of the question and the situation at hand. You can do this by asking clarification questions. 

For example, if the question is “Describe the tradeoffs with adding Reactions to YouTube videos”, you can ask the following:

By Reactions, are we referring to the typical popular reactions that represent happiness, sadness, anger, laughter, etc.?Is there any particular company objective you’d like me to keep in mind or can I select what I think is the company objective at this time?

By Reactions, are we referring to the typical popular reactions that represent happiness, sadness, anger, laughter, etc.?

Is there any particular company objective you’d like me to keep in mind or can I select what I think is the company objective at this time?



The interviewer could then say that they are considering enabling  YouTube users to respond to a video with popular reactions and that you are allowed to come up with your own objective.



This is where you gather the relevant attributes to the decision in front of you and share them with the interviewer. Think of these attributes as the deciding factors that you would take into consideration in your decision.

In our Reactions example, here are some attributes that come to mind: 

Engagement: It’s important to keep in mind that the Reactions feature can have an impact on engagement. As more reactions are provided, it will most likely increase the number of reaction engagements per 1,000 views, since the users can now react in more ways than just a thumbs up or thumbs down.Improved UX in expressing emotions: Overall, the UX will be improved for the users since they will be able to better express their emotions after watching a video. There may be a bit more friction in submitting a reaction, but it will be an advantage in the long run, as there is enough industry evidence showing that people prefer a range of reactions rather than just a binary one.Slight UX friction: Having a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down reaction is easier to learn than having a range to choose from.  Reactions generally require two steps to complete—click on the reaction icon and select and submit the reaction. Giving viewers more choices may lead to dissatisfaction; some users might be overwhelmed with all the options and find it harder to respond.Engineering work: This change will have a significant impact on various aspects of the product, e.g., in how YouTube videos are presented (the number of likes used to be a key indicator of the popularity of a video), the layout of the pages, the API access, and our algorithm to determine the video’s SEO ranking based on various emotional responses.User experience in choosing videos: This is a new territory for YouTube. There might be some initial negative impacts on YouTube search and discovery. Users will have to get used to potentially lower numbers of likes going forward because viewers might be expressing their emotions in other ways. The journey of a YouTube user is very different from that of a Facebook Watch or LinkedIn video viewer; YouTube users do not land on a video from their newsfeed. They search for the video themselves, or it gets recommended to them. Expressing emotions might be more relevant when you are expressing it to people you know. If that is the case, perhaps having a range of emotional reactions on YouTube is not as relevant. A simple thumbs up / thumbs down makes it easier for people to say if they like or dislike a video.Migration: The migration of videos from the current thumbs up  / thumbs down model can be tricky since all will have 0 reactions in the beginning. It can be misleading and confusing to the viewer, who might think that the video is not being watched.Competitive landscape: Other video platforms such as Instagram and Facebook are already offering reactions. Users expect to see such a feature as well on YouTube.

Engagement: It’s important to keep in mind that the Reactions feature can have an impact on engagement. As more reactions are provided, it will most likely increase the number of reaction engagements per 1,000 views, since the users can now react in more ways than just a thumbs up or thumbs down.

Improved UX in expressing emotions: Overall, the UX will be improved for the users since they will be able to better express their emotions after watching a video. There may be a bit more friction in submitting a reaction, but it will be an advantage in the long run, as there is enough industry evidence showing that people prefer a range of reactions rather than just a binary one.

Note that some interviewees, such as in the above case, only want you to 

List the tradeoffs with the product choice that you are faced with andExplain the pros and cons of each approach.

Explain the pros and cons of each approach. 



There are also cases where the interviewer wants you to go a few steps further and use the tradeoff analysis to decide which path is the right one to go forward. For example, the interview question above could have been  “Should we add Reactions to YouTube?” In this case, you will have to continue your answer and complete steps 3 and 4, described below.

It is important to note that the interview question “Should we add  Reactions to YouTube?” sounds very similar to a Product Strategy interview question type. In fact, you can use either a Product Strategy or tradeoff question here. As a general rule of thumb, when the question is purely product-related and the interviewer gives you two options,  it’s easier to apply the tradeoff framework to answer the question.



In this step, identify the main high-level objective that you think you must keep in mind as you decide which path to take. The objective will help you decide how to prioritize and analyze the pros and cons of your choices for the attributes that you have highlighted.

For our YouTube example, you can say that since YouTube has already captured a large market share, driving engagement would be the best goal you could focus on. 







In this final step, you provide an overview of your evaluation (done in step 2) and describe how the pros and cons of your options led to your decision, especially when taking your goal into consideration.

For our YouTube Reactions example, you can say that given that the main goal of YouTube at this point is to grow engagement among the existing users and direct correlation between better video discovery and more engagement, it is important to prioritize features that enhance the video discovery experience. 

You can add that support for reactions will not result in significantly more reactions at this time because the reactions help viewers discover videos that people in their social network emotionally react to. However, on YouTube, people find videos using Search,  YouTube’s recommendation, links shared, and YouTube Discovery. None of these sources of video selection really need the user to understand the emotional reaction of someone prior to watching it.

Indeed, there is value in enabling users to express their emotions in a video. However, the engagement impact will not be as significant on video discovery. As a result, the recommendation is to not prioritize Emotions for YouTube videos at this time.
