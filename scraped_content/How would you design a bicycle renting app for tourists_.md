### Why are Product Design Questions asked?



Product design is an integral aspect of the product management process. It involves taking an idea and turning it into a fully-realized, usable product. In the product design process, product managers must consider a wide range of factors, including customer needs, technical requirements, and business goals.

One way for an interviewer to assess a candidate's ability to design products effectively is to ask product design interview questions. These questions are designed to help interviewers understand the candidate's thought process, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.

1. One of the key things that product design interview questions evaluate is a candidate's ability to think structurally in an ambiguous environment. Product management often involves making decisions with incomplete information and understanding how to proceed despite uncertainty.
2. Another important aspect of product design is identifying pain points in the customer journey. This involves understanding customer needs and pinpointing areas where the current product or service falls short. Good product managers are able to listen to customer feedback and use it to inform product decisions.
3. Product design also requires creativity and imagination. Interviewers may ask questions that evaluate a candidate's ability to come up with new and innovative solutions to design problems.
4. Additionally, being able to estimate the required efforts, time, and costs that would be needed to implement a product design is a key factor in any product management interview.

### 2. Goal

In today's world, there is a growing interest in using bicycles as a way to explore new cities and destinations. Many people choose to use bicycles for exercise, sightseeing, or transportation. However, for tourists who are not familiar with the area, finding a reliable bicycle rental shop can be a challenging task. In order to make it easier for tourists to rent bicycles and promote cycling as a mode of transportation, a bicycle renting app for tourists is needed.

The goal of this project is to design a bicycle renting app that will help tourists to rent bicycles easily and conveniently. The app aims to promote sightseeing, transportation, and cycling, while also contributing to reducing traffic congestion and pollution. The app will be designed with the needs of tourists in mind, making it simple and intuitive to use, with clear and concise information about available bicycles, rental rates, and other details.

Goal: Design a bicycle renting app to promote sightseeing, transportation, cycling and reduce traffic & pollution.

### 3. User Segments

The bicycle-renting app could target the following three main user segments:

1. Tourists: This is the primary user group, comprising solo travellers, groups of friends, and families. Their main objectives are to explore popular tourist destinations in the city, such as museums, zoos, monuments, and other sightseeing spots. The app aims to provide a convenient and affordable way for tourists to explore the city at their own pace while reducing traffic congestion and pollution.
2. Guides/Travel Agencies: This user segment may want to include bike rentals as an optional service for their customers. The app can provide a platform for these users to make bookings and manage their rentals.
3. Locals: This segment of users would use the app primarily for daily travel and errands. By renting bikes instead of driving or using public transportation, locals can save time, money, and reduce their carbon footprint.
