The core responsibility of a product manager is to drive product vision, design and development. A business decides to make a product because it has identified a real customer need for which the customer is willing to pay. It is the role of the product manager to identify customer needs and drive the design and development of products that meet those needs.

This product design interview question tests whether you understand the process of going from customer needs to product development. This process should involve defining who the customer is and what they want to accomplish; defining multiple use case scenarios in which the customer does activities that are related to your product, and prioritizing what to build.

What is the interviewer looking for?

The interviewer is evaluating you on the following:

Do you provide keen insights about the customer and their needs?Are you able to provide multiple and diverse use case scenarios?Is your answer structured and logical, or do you go off on a tangent?Do you go beyond generalities in your solutions and provide detailed descriptions?Can you provide ideas that no other candidate has mentioned?Are you confident and sound credible? Would engineers and product people follow your lead?

Do you provide keen insights about the customer and their needs?

Are you able to provide multiple and diverse use case scenarios?

Is your answer structured and logical, or do you go off on a tangent?

Do you go beyond generalities in your solutions and provide detailed descriptions?

Can you provide ideas that no other candidate has mentioned?

Are you confident and sound credible? Would engineers and product people follow your lead?

How to structure your answer?

The steps of this method are:

C — Clarify. Ask questions to clarify what you are unsure of or confirm/disconfirm assumptions.

I — Identify the users/customers as personas like food lovers, soccer moms, etc.

R — Report on their needs (use cases). A use case is an activity that a user would like to do relative to your product.

C — Cut through and prioritize the use cases based on some attributes (revenue, customer benefit, complexity).

L — List solutions.

E — Evaluate the tradeoffs of your solutions.

S — Summarize:

State which solution you would recommend.Recap what the solution does and why it is beneficial.Explain why you prefer this solution. 

State which solution you would recommend.

Recap what the solution does and why it is beneficial.

Explain why you prefer this solution. 

Answer



Ask Clarifying questions

Before you start designing the product, it is important to clarify and narrow down the scope of the question and get confirmation from the interviewer that they agree with your scope.

Here are a few things you'd like to get clarity on:

Q) Which dogs are we referring to (Domestic / Street)?Let’s assume domestic dogs only.

Q) What problem you are referring to? Let’s assume that they are referring to the fact that some people do not clean after their dogs when the dogs poop in public places such as parks. I will also ask if it’s ok for me to focus on a particular type of public place such as a park.

Q) Preference for the form and shape of the product – solution? Whether it be hardware or software (an app or a web service). For the sake of this interview, I’m going to assume that I can choose any form of solution I like. My preference would be an app since it’s scalable but I can give a better answer once I brainstorm some ideas.

Objective

I would also ask for clarity on the objective. I think that a good objective in this could be a reduction in the number of dog poops that are in the public areas on any given day.

Identifying Users Groups

I would like to first think about the user groups that are involved with the dog poop problem:

Dogs: they poop.Dog owners / caretakers: they sometimes don’t take their dogs’ poops.City workers: they have to clean the dog poop.Innocent Citizens: they see the dog poop in public places and are the main losers in this dog poop problem. They feel disgusted by the dog poop. They might even step on them and make their shoes dirty.

Dogs: they poop.

Dog owners / caretakers: they sometimes don’t take their dogs’ poops.

City workers: they have to clean the dog poop.

Innocent Citizens: they see the dog poop in public places and are the main losers in this dog poop problem. They feel disgusted by the dog poop. They might even step on them and make their shoes dirty.

I’m going to focus on the Innocent Citizens since they are the ones feeling most of the pain. Another approach could have been focusing on the dog poop owners since they are the cause of the problem.

Listing Use Cases

I can think of the following use cases:

If I focus on the Innocent Citizens, here are a few use cases/needs I can think about among this group:

They might witness someone not cleaning after their dog.They might accidentally step on dog poop.They will need a way to clean their shoes after stepping on them.They would like to find someone and ask them to remove the dog poop

They might witness someone not cleaning after their dog.

They might accidentally step on dog poop.

They will need a way to clean their shoes after stepping on them.

They would like to find someone and ask them to remove the dog poop



I’m sure there are other use cases one can think of. For this interview, I’m going to focus on the above 4 cases and come up with a few ideas that solve for the listed use cases.In case we want to focus on the dog owners:

As a dog owner/caretaker, it's a heavy mess when dog poops in parks or all around the house as I have to spend time & money cleaning it. It's a frustrating experience for me when my dog poops and the odour of it destroys the ambiance of my place.

Listing Solutions



Enable them to take pictures and videos of the dog owner who’s not cleaning after their dog, tag their location and time, and inform neighbors of the dog owner’s behavior as a way to put pressure on the dog owners to clean after their dogs.Provide the location and time of the picture of dog poop to the users of the platform (let’s say it’s an app) so that city workers can use the information to spot the poop and remove it.The app can determine dog-poop safe walking paths based on the info provided by the users.Place dog poop bags and remover sticks across parks to make it easier for people to remove the poop they see in the park.Organize dog poop removal days in parks asking volunteers to come in and help clean the park by removing any poop they see. Acknowledge and reward those who find and remove the highest number of poop

Few solutions targetting the dog owners as the users: -

Create a device, for example, "tail watch". Attach this device to either leg of the dog. Dogs usually come to a special backward leaning position while pooping. The tail watch will detect the position and will send notifications to the owner. The notification will snooze as a constant reminder to clean the poop once it is done. The app associated with the device in future can be extended which will help the dog owner to find the nearest poop bag in the park. The app will also help in tracking the pooping schedule pattern of the dog and will let the user know about the pooping schedule and behavior so that the owner can plan the park trip accordingly with full preparation.

Prioritizing Solutions



Now, here is how I would go about ranking the ideas based on impact on the innocent citizen and cost of implementation.

Idea 1 – Medium impact as it can result in people being called out by their neighbors for being irresponsible, increasing the pressure for being socially responsible. This might even result in some arguments between neighbors. One challenge will also be getting users to review pictures and videos and mentioning who the dog owners are. People might not care about this. The cost of implementation is low as it’s a fairly straightforward app. Driving the adoption of the app will most likely be high

Idea 2 – High impact as it can have two positive effects: remove dog poops faster and help people avoid stepping on dog poop. The cost of implementation is low (develop the app)

Idea 3 – Medium impact as many users will not be using the app for walking in the park. It’s a lot of work for the average user. Plus, they might decide to continue their pre-determined path and just watch for dog poop rather than changing paths.

Idea 4 – Medium impact as many people might not be willing to take the time to remove someone else’s dog poop. The cost of implementation is high as you need physical devices in all parks all around the country.

Idea 5 – Medium impact since it’s not a sexy/good cause purpose to inspire people to participate on. The cost of implementation is high as you would need to organize so many events across the country on an ongoing basis to have a positive impact

Recommendation

Out of the ideas listed above, I suggest implementing idea 2. It has a direct impact on reducing the time a dog poop stays on the ground, therefore resulting in less dog poop in public places. In addition, the cost of implementation is low. You just need to develop an app that enables people to add a picture, add information such as time, location, and direction, and send that info to the park/city workers. You can also inform users once a dog poop is removed as a way to present the positive outcome of their work and to encourage them to continue their behavior (reporting dog poop).
