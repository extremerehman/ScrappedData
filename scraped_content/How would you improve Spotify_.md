Spotify is a popular global audio streaming platform that provides users with access to an extensive library of music, podcasts, and other audio content. The service is designed to offer users the ability to listen to their desired audio content at any time and from anywhere in the world. The content available on Spotify is provided by individual artists and creators, as well as through aggregators and syndicated deals brokered by Spotify.

It operates as a marketplace, with artists and creators on one side, fans on the other, and brands in the mix. The platform's subscription model drives most of its revenue, but it also offers a freemium version supported by advertising for non-subscribers. 

The company's mission is to "unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it."

It's core features include a vast music catalogue, an intuitive user experience, and affordable pricing plans. However, what sets Spotify apart is its constant innovation through design, social features, and recommendation engines that power the discovery of new music and other audio content.

Spotify's recommendation engines are especially noteworthy, as they allow users to discover new artists and content based on their listening habits and preferences. The platform's algorithm analyzes a user's listening history and provides personalized recommendations that are tailored to their interests. This feature has made Spotify a go-to platform for music lovers who want to discover new artists and genres.

Spotify can be accessed from a desktop web, desktop app, mobile web, and mobile app (Android, IOS).

Some of the major competitors of Spotify  are Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, YouTube Music, SoundCloud, JioSaavn, Gaana, Wynk Music, Deezer, Hungama etc.



Step 2. Ask clarifying questions to narrow the scope. (Q)

Q) Why are we thinking about improvements now? Is this in response to a competitor initiative or industry event? 

A) Spotify has recently faced criticism for minimally compensating artists and giving them less autonomy.

Step 3. Define the Goal you want to achieve. (G)



As previously mentioned, Spotify's mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by providing a platform for creative artists to share their work and for fans to enjoy and be inspired by it. 

One of the key metrics that determines the success of this mission is user engagement, which is measured by the number of minutes of songs streamed per user per day.

Spotify faces competition from other streaming services such as SoundCloud, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music. Therefore, it's important for Spotify to keep its users engaged and provide a unique experience that sets it apart from its competitors. Higher engagement leads to more users, which in turn attracts more artists and studios to the platform. This creates a flywheel effect that drives an increase in streams, and ultimately, revenue.



Step 4. List the User Segments and choose one segment to focus on. (U)



Broadly, Spotify users can be divided into,



Artists:Spotify's user base can be divided into different segments, and one of the most important segments is the group of artists who create content for the platform. These artists are at the core of Spotify's mission, as the platform was originally built to help them gain exposure and reach a wider audience. Here are two subgroups within this user segment:Independent Artists: These are artists who create their own content and release it on Spotify without the help of a record label or production company. Independent artists often use Spotify as a platform to build their audience and gain recognition for their work.Studio-affiliated Artists: These are artists who work with a record label, music studio, or production company to create and release their content on Spotify. These artists may have more resources and support in creating their music, but they still rely on Spotify to distribute their content and reach a wider audience.Listeners: Listeners on Spotify can be segmented in a variety of ways, based on their usage patterns, context, music preferences, and more. Based on the Usage:One common way to segment Spotify listeners is based on their usage, which can be broken down into two categories:Casual Listener: This type of user only uses Spotify occasionally, doesn't mind ads, and listens to music and podcasts on a sporadic basis. Spotify would want to engage these users more to convert them into more active listeners and potential paying subscribers.Power User: This type of user is highly engaged, with multiple playlists and a love for Spotify's social features. They dislike ads and appreciate the ability to listen to music across multiple devices, as well as the extensive library of songs and podcasts available.

Here are some examples of user segments based on music taste:Pop Music Fans: These users enjoy listening to popular, mainstream music, often featuring catchy hooks and upbeat rhythms.Hip-Hop Fans: These users enjoy listening to hip-hop and rap music, often featuring hard-hitting beats and lyrics that focus on themes such as social justice and personal struggle.Rock Music Fans: These users enjoy listening to various sub-genres of rock music, including classic rock, alternative, and indie rock.Electronic Music Fans: These users enjoy listening to various forms of electronic music, including techno, house, and trance.Country Music Fans: These users enjoy listening to country music, often featuring themes such as love, heartbreak, and life in rural America.Classical Music Fans: These users enjoy listening to classical music, including works by famous composers such as Beethoven and Mozart.World Music Fans: These users enjoy listening to music from different cultures around the world, such as African drumming, Indian classical music, or Latin American salsa.Advertisers:Another way to segment users on Spotify is based on their role as advertisers. In this case, there are two main segments:Big Brands: These are large companies with significant marketing budgets who are looking to advertise their products or services to a wide audience.

They may use Spotify's self-serve ad platform to create and manage their own campaigns, or work with third-party ad agencies to help them create and optimize their ads.

Advertisers:Another way to segment users on Spotify is based on their role as advertisers. In this case, there are two main segments:

Big Brands: These are large companies with significant marketing budgets who are looking to advertise their products or services to a wide audience. They may use Spotify's ad targeting features to reach specific demographics or geographic regions, and may also partner with Spotify to create branded content or sponsored playlists.Small Businesses: These are smaller companies or local businesses who may have more limited marketing budgets but still want to reach a targeted audience through Spotify's platform.

Out of the different user groups, I believe that it is important to focus on improving the product for the Artist user group. This is because any improvements made in this area will result in more original content being available on Spotify. By having a greater variety of quality content, Spotify can attract more listeners, thus reducing acquisition costs. 

Additionally, if budding artists are able to create world-class content based on their talent and the user preference data that Spotify has collected over the years, this could improve user engagement and conversion rates. As Spotify's mission is to help these budding artists live off their art, it is important to address any pain points they may be experiencing. By doing so, Spotify can further differentiate itself from competitors such as Apple Music and YouTube.



Step 5.   List and prioritize the Pain Points. (P)

Major pain points of the Artists user segments are,

The main concern of artists is that they are not being fairly compensated for their work. Spotify's low earnings and royalties derived from streams have been criticized, making it difficult for artists to earn a living from their music. This has been a major pain point for artists and Spotify has been called out for not delivering on its mission to help artists "live off their art."Although many features are available for artists to promote and gain insights on their music, these tools often have a steep learning curve that requires time and effort to learn effectively. This is especially challenging for content creators who have limited time and resources. One such example is artist fundraising, which can be a difficult concept for many artists to understand and utilize.This pain point can hinder artists' ability to effectively market their music and grow their fanbase.Limited budgets for promotional tools can also be a pain point for artists. They may not fully understand how to optimize their marketing dollars for success, which can lead to them not using these promotional tools at all.Artists may face challenges in keeping their fans engaged and top of mind without having new releases. They may be contractually bound, making it difficult to drop new releases as and when they please. In order to reach their user base, artists need to offer more enhanced content like their artist websites or tickets for shows.This pain point can impact their ability to maintain a loyal fanbase and stay relevant on the platform.Difficulty in building and sustaining a loyal fanbase, as there are millions of other artists competing for attention on the platform.Spotify's lack of comprehensive genre specification can also be a pain point for artists and fans alike. The current search functionality is hit and miss, and there is no facility to distinguish between artist names and song names, making it difficult for fans to search back catalog and for artists to optimize their music for search.This pain point can impact artists' ability to optimize their music for search and fans' ability to discover new music within their preferred genres.Limited control over how their music is presented and promoted on the platform, which can lead to their work being buried or overshadowed by more established artists or mainstream releases. This pain point affects artists' visibility and success on the platform.Although data analytics tools can provide valuable insights, it can be difficult for new artists to gauge any insights with any real confidence given the low numbers. This can be a pain point for artists who are trying to establish themselves.
