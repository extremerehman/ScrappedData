The interviewer wants to know whether your goals are a match for the company. Your answer also allows an interviewer to see whether your skills and interests make you a good candidate for the job at hand. 

 They might also be trying to determine whether you’ll be a good long-term fit for the company. Are you looking for an opportunity to grow with an organization — or will your plans take you to another employer soon.







It’s best if you don’t bring your emotional baggage with you while answering this question,  saying out any one of these things will leave a bad impression on the Hiring Manager : 



I want a better company. I don’t like the culture at my current company. It’s too much work, long hours and exhausting. Also, there is too much office politics etc.(Red Flag - Candidate’s outlook might be negative)I want a better Boss. I don’t like my current boss as he assigns a lot of work.(Red Flag - Candidate might be bad at managing work and relationships with colleagues)I want a very high-paying job. I want more than 100% hike.(Red Flag - Candidate might be too ambitious and might not stay for long)I want a better role. I don’t like my current role and the job responsibilities that are forcefully assigned to me.

The answer to this question can be Thoughtful and Strategic. It’s better to focus on the learning side of things and how it would help you in your career at the target company.



This is usually the follow-up question after “Why do you want to leave your current job?” and here is how it should be answered,



Self Improvement -  I am really passionate about data science and want to enhance my product management skills in that area.Accountability - I am looking for a role that would help me become more responsible as I feel the more the responsibilities the more it would help me learn and grow faster in my career.Strategic - I want exposure to a new industry or area that would help me learn and apply my skills from a different angle.

These questions are more personal, so there is room for a lot of variabilities.









Early Career:



I am in the learning phase of my career, so in my next role, I am looking for a strong Mentor to guide my learning and accelerate my growth. I am excited for the opportunity to be on a high-growth team so that I can contribute to the best of my capabilities, take feedback, learn from my mistakes, and grow in my career.



Mid Career:



I’ve had exposure to different technologies, companies, and business models in my career to date. What interests me at this time is to be in a role where I could be part of a company that is in the hypergrowth phase, where I can experience and participate in rapidly scaling technologies, systems, and products.

I believe that this will unlock learnings for me that will accelerate my career and better understand the business that I am helping built from within and grow.



Late Career:



I have been working in the technology industry for almost 15 years. I have worked on everything from Bio-Tech to Software Platforms to IoT and in organizations of all sizes and different business models.

I am looking for an opportunity to bring all this knowledge and experience to bear in a role where I can leverage these learnings. I would like to continue to hone my approach to building products and engineering teams that have a huge impact on business.
