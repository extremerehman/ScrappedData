Ask Clarifying Questions:

Should we be focusing on a specific region: domestic or international? A) You choose. Is there a specific user you want to focus on? Prospect v. current user, etc.? A) You choose. 

Should we be focusing on a specific region: domestic or international? A) You choose. 

Is there a specific user you want to focus on? Prospect v. current user, etc.? A) You choose. 

Describe the Product: 

WhatsApp is a messaging app that is owned by Facebook. It allows users to send voice and text messages, make voice and video calls and share images / videos, etc. It is generally used on mobile devices but does have a desktop component as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app. It is popularly used to make international messages and is used in a variety of countries, including the US, India, Brazil, Indonesia, etc.

Goal: 

The goal of the AB tests will be to increase the number of messages sent and received on WhatsApp. 

User Groups: 

There are two types of user groups we can focus on. For these AB tests, I'd like to focus on existing users.  

Prospects: Have never used WhatsApp. Would need to focus on bringing them into the platform to increase the overall user population/messages being sent and received.Existing Users: Current users of WhatsApp though usage may vary from low usage to power usage.

Existing Users: Current users of WhatsApp though usage may vary from low usage to power usage. 



Brainstorm AB Test Ideas:



Push Notification Reminders: Send push notification reminders to a selected groups to get them to engage in WhatsApp. Hypothesis: Users who receive push notification reminders to use WhatsApp (e.g. to check unread messages) will send more messages. Experiment: Control Group A: Does not receive any push notifications. Would have to be a similar group to Target Group B (ex. same region, age, etc.)Target Group B: Receives push notifications to get them to engage in the app. For example, "Don't forget to check in with your friends using WhatsApp." “Don’t forget to check your unread messages”.Success Metrics:Average number of messages/user sent by Group B v. ATotal messages sent by Group B v. ATime between next message sent and push notification (ex. did users in B send a message right after they received the push notification)Trade-Offs: Users may have turned off push notifications from WhatsAppUsers may not enjoy additional "Marketing" like notifications.Personalized Recommendations: Send personalized notifications to users to remind them to check in with someone they may have lost touch with.Hypothesis: Users who received personalized notifications will use WhatsApp to send more messagesExperiment: Control Group A: Does not receive any personalized notifications. Would have to be a similar group to Target Group B (ex. same region, age, etc.)Target Group B: Receives personalized notifications to get them to engage in the app with a person they recently lost touch with. For example, "You last messaged Person X 3 weeks ago. Do you want to check in with them?"Success Metrics:Average number of messages/user sent by Group B v. ATotal messages sent by Group B v. A.Number of messages received by average recipient in Group A v. recommended recipients in Group B.Trade-Offs:Users may deliberately not want to contact someone (ex. recent ex, friend they had a fall out with, etc.). Would need a strong algorithm to determine if a person should be a recommended recipient. Users may not want WhatsApp "reading" their texts. Privacy concerns. Connection Marketing Campaign: Create an email marketing campaign around maintaining connections via WhatsApp.   Hypothesis: Users who receive the marketing email will engage with WhatsApp more / send more messages. Experiment: Control Group A: Does not receive any email. Would have to be a similar group to Target Group B (ex. same region, age, etc.)Target Group B: Receives email encouraging user to engage with WhatsApp. Email could focus on how WhatsApp helps you maintain connection especially when everyone is virtual in COVID. Success Metrics: Average number of messages/user sent by Group B v. ATotal messages sent by Group B v. AClicks on email (assuming there is a link in email that links to WhatsApp)Trade-Offs:Not every user will click email / open WhatsAppEmails could go to Spam. Users may not like receiving marketing emails from WhatsApp. Could be seen as an annoyance / deleted without being read.Auto- Suggest Reply: It is possibe that users do not reply much because they find typing hard. Hypothesis: System suggested messages will help users send quick reply from pre-composed message.Experiment:Control Group: Will not see any auto-suggested repliesExperiment Group: Will see auto-suggested repliesIn both cases, Users with medium engagement with same demograph will be the part of the experimentSuccess Metric: 1. # of messages in experiment group should increase2. # of Unread messages should decrease.3. Average # of messages per user should increase.4. # of automated messages/# of total messages should increase over time.Trade Off:It is possible that users still prefer to call Vs send auto messages if user did not get suggested message that user liked.Business Partnership: Partner with an eCommerce business to get them to use WhatsApp as a vehicle to contact their buyers for advertisements, notifications of delivery of items, etc.Hypothesis: Buyers from businesses who have the opportunity to sign up for WhatsApp notifications will receive more messages.Experiment: Control Group A: Does not receive any option to sign up for WhatsApp notifications. Would have to be a similar group to Target Group B (ex. same region, age, etc.)Target Group B: Has the ability to opt-into WhatsApp notifications on business website and during check out. (For example, sign up for notifications of sales via WhatsApp or notifications of delivery of your parcel via WhatsApp.)Success Metrics:# of people / % of people in Experimental Group B that sign up for notificationsAverage number of messages received by user in Group B v. Group A.Trade-Offs:Target Group B is limited in size. The group must sign up for notifications on third-party site. Less control over getting them to sign up.Much more complex test because of third-party than quick AB test via WhatsApp app. Higher cost to set up automated notifications of things like status of delivery.

Business Partnership: Partner with an eCommerce business to get them to use WhatsApp as a vehicle to contact their buyers for advertisements, notifications of delivery of items, etc.

Hypothesis: Buyers from businesses who have the opportunity to sign up for WhatsApp notifications will receive more messages.Experiment: Control Group A: Does not receive any option to sign up for WhatsApp notifications. Would have to be a similar group to Target Group B (ex. same region, age, etc.)Target Group B: Has the ability to opt-into WhatsApp notifications on business website and during check out. (For example, sign up for notifications of sales via WhatsApp or notifications of delivery of your parcel via WhatsApp.)Success Metrics:# of people / % of people in Experimental Group B that sign up for notificationsAverage number of messages received by user in Group B v. Group A.Trade-Offs:Target Group B is limited in size. The group must sign up for notifications on third-party site. Less control over getting them to sign up.Much more complex test because of third-party than quick AB test via WhatsApp app. Higher cost to set up automated notifications of things like status of delivery.

Prioritize AB Tests:

Recommendation:

Based on the prioritization, I would choose to run an AB test during which we send generic push notifications to users to get them to engage in WhatsApp. Given that WhatsApp already has push notifications built, running this test should be fairly low cost.
