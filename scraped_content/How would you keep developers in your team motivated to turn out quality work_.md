Product Managers get to enjoy the fun and challenge of dealing with a wide, and diverse group of people. Among all the teams the Engineering, QA, Design & Analytics teams are the ones we have to work with almost on a daily basis. 

Now, how do we motivate so many teams over whom we have no authority? 

First, let's understand what could go wrong that could lead to demotivation among team members. Some examples of it are,



I don't know what I'm working on.  #PlanningI don't know why I'm working on it.  #GoalClarity I don't know what my impact has been.  #Impact #OutcomeI keep getting shifted from one project to another.  #ContextSwitchingthe feature I worked on didn't work out.  #Failure I keep getting the same work.  #BoredomThe current work doesn't excite me.   #NeedtoLearn

I don't know what I'm working on.  #Planning

I don't know why I'm working on it.  #GoalClarity 

I don't know what my impact has been.  #Impact #Outcome

I keep getting shifted from one project to another.  #ContextSwitching

the feature I worked on didn't work out.  #Failure 

I keep getting the same work.  #Boredom

The current work doesn't excite me.   #NeedtoLearn





1. Communicate the vision.



Create a shared vision: It’s important that every team member understand what the priorities of the company are, and how their work ties into it. Team-wide presentations that talk about the company goal and the importance of each project, and one-on-one conversations with individual members are both important.



Leverage stakeholders:  Request your stakeholders to come and talk (multiple times in different stages) to the team about the importance of your projects. 

2. Collaborative Planning



Once the initial roadmap planning is complete, it is important to bring the tech stakeholders into a room and get feedback.

Do they agree with the roadmap - Does anything need to be removed/added?What can be picked for the initial phases?What tech-related items need to be added for planning?

Do they agree with the roadmap - Does anything need to be removed/added?

What can be picked for the initial phases?

What tech-related items need to be added for planning?



The outcome is a list of feature/product items we want to ship in order of their priority.

3. Create accountability and urgency



Once the vision & planning is clear, the next important thing is to get them to work efficiently by creating Milestones and Delivery Dates.

Break the epic (big task) into multiple phases (small tasks) and set a deadline for each of them keeping some additional buffer (in case the project slips). Make sure the relevant teams (eg. engineering or design) have a  voice in setting the deadline. 

4. Learning Growth



Work with them to ensure that the work they are doing is contributing to their learning and pushing the boundaries of their current knowledge.

5. Communicate



Communicate the results and impact with the team. Celebrate and Praise on every win, big or small. Gather the learnings when you don't win, it's important to ensure you don't repeat mistakes and reduces the probability of failure in the future.
