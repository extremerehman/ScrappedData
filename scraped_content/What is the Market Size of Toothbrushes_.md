Market sizing, as a concept, involves estimating the potential revenue a product or service could generate if it captured 100% of the market. It's a vital step in strategic planning for businesses, helping them make informed decisions on product development, pricing, marketing, and resource allocation.

Market sizing questions in interviews assess various skills, including analytical thinking, problem-solving, quantitative skills, communication, creativity, and adaptability. Candidates are expected to approach complex problems in a structured, logical manner, emphasizing thought processes over precise answers.

Top-Down Approach vs. Bottom-Up Approach: The top-down approach starts with a large number and refines it, while the bottom-up approach starts with a small number and builds up. For this toothbrush market sizing, we'll use the top-down approach.

## 1. Market size of Non-Electric Toothbrushes in US Market:



#### Step 1: Clarifying Questions

* How are we defining market size?
* Are we including all types of toothbrushes, both electric and disposable?
* Are we determining the market size of toothbrushes globally?

How are we defining market size?

Are we including all types of toothbrushes, both electric and disposable?

Are we determining the market size of toothbrushes globally?

Assuming the definition is the total sales in one year and we are focusing on disposable, non-electric toothbrushes in the United States.

#### Step 2: Developing a Top-Down Framework

1. Start with the U.S. population:The U.S. population is approximately 320 million. This forms the foundation of our estimation.
2. The U.S. population is approximately 320 million. This forms the foundation of our estimation.
3. Estimate the percentage of the population that brushes their teeth:Assuming 95% of the population practices good oral hygiene, we proceed with this estimation.
4. Assuming 95% of the population practices good oral hygiene, we proceed with this estimation.
5. Estimate the percentage using regular toothbrushes:Assuming 75% of the population uses regular toothbrushes rather than electric ones.
6. Assuming 75% of the population uses regular toothbrushes rather than electric ones.
7. Estimate the average number of toothbrushes used per person per year:Assuming an average of 5 toothbrushes per person annually.
8. Assuming an average of 5 toothbrushes per person annually.
9. Estimate the cost per toothbrush:Assuming a cost of $2 per toothbrush.
10. Assuming a cost of $2 per toothbrush.
11. Calculate the Market Size:320 million x 95% x 75% x 5 x $2This calculation yields a market size of $2.28 billion for disposable, non-electric toothbrushes in the United States.
12. 320 million x 95% x 75% x 5 x $2
13. This calculation yields a market size of $2.28 billion for disposable, non-electric toothbrushes in the United States.

Start with the U.S. population:

* The U.S. population is approximately 320 million. This forms the foundation of our estimation.

The U.S. population is approximately 320 million. This forms the foundation of our estimation.

Estimate the percentage of the population that brushes their teeth:

* Assuming 95% of the population practices good oral hygiene, we proceed with this estimation.

Assuming 95% of the population practices good oral hygiene, we proceed with this estimation.

Estimate the percentage using regular toothbrushes:

* Assuming 75% of the population uses regular toothbrushes rather than electric ones.

Assuming 75% of the population uses regular toothbrushes rather than electric ones.

Estimate the average number of toothbrushes used per person per year:

* Assuming an average of 5 toothbrushes per person annually.

Assuming an average of 5 toothbrushes per person annually.

Estimate the cost per toothbrush:

* Assuming a cost of $2 per toothbrush.

Assuming a cost of $2 per toothbrush.

Calculate the Market Size:

* 320 million x 95% x 75% x 5 x $2
* This calculation yields a market size of $2.28 billion for disposable, non-electric toothbrushes in the United States.

320 million x 95% x 75% x 5 x $2

This calculation yields a market size of $2.28 billion for disposable, non-electric toothbrushes in the United States.



#### Reasoning Behind Assumptions:

* Population Estimates: The U.S. population figure is a widely known and accepted estimate. The assumption that 95% of the population brushes their teeth is a reasonable approximation based on oral hygiene norms.
* Choice of Regular Toothbrushes: Assuming 75% use regular toothbrushes aligns with common usage patterns, considering factors such as accessibility and cost.
* Average Toothbrush Usage: The assumption of 5 toothbrushes per person per year is a rounded estimate based on the idea of changing toothbrushes once in more than 2  month, emphasizing simplicity for ease of calculation.
* Cost per Toothbrush: Assuming a cost of $2 per toothbrush is a reasonable midpoint that accommodates variations in pricing without overly complicating calculations.

#### Sense Checking the Answer:

It's crucial to sense check the final answer to ensure reasonability. In this case, evaluating the estimated market size against key assumptions is essential.

* Population Coverage: The calculation that around two-thirds of the population uses regular toothbrushes seems reasonable, considering the assumed penetration rate of electric toothbrushes.
* Toothbrush Usage and Cost: Assuming 5 toothbrushes per person per year and a cost of $2 per toothbrush aligns with general oral care practices and market pricing.

#### Determining implications of the Answer:

Beyond arriving at a market size figure, it's essential to consider the implications of this information,

* Market Attractiveness: A market size of $2.28 billion suggests a substantial market for disposable, non-electric toothbrushes in the U.S. This could be considered an attractive opportunity for a business entering or expanding in the toothbrush market.
* Recommendations: If a business is contemplating entering the toothbrush market, the size indicates significant potential. If the market growth rate and profit margins are favorable, it might strengthen the recommendation.
