The map of India looks like a Rombus, doesnâ€™t it?



Known:

The area of Rombus = (Product of Diagonals)/2

Distance = Speed x Time





For the diagonals, we need to calculate the distance between (North-South) & (East-West)



Assumption:

The area of the islands is considered to be insignificant, hence excluded.The average speed of Trains in India ~ 50km/hr

The area of the islands is considered to be insignificant, hence excluded.

The average speed of Trains in India ~ 50km/hr







Time taken to travel from North to South by Trains,

= Jammu to Delhi +  Delhi to Kanyakumari

= 10hrs + 50hrs

= 60 hrs



Distance = 50 x 60 = 3000 KM



Time taken to travel from East to West  by Trains,

= Ahmedabad  to Delhi + Delhi to Itanagar

= 10 hrs + 40 hrs

= 50hrs



Distance = 50 x 50 = 2500 KM





Area of India, 

= (Product of Diagonals)/2

= (3000 x 2500) / 2

= 7500000 / 2

= 3.75 million km sq



Actual Area of India = 3.28 million km sq.
