Why are Product Execution Questions asked?



Product Execution questions evaluate your ability to discover the root cause of a  problem and to come up with solutions to address it. 



The interviewer wants to see that you are able to : 

Consider various potential root causes for a problem in a systematic way.Break down a problem-solving process into a step-by-step diagnosis.Come up with a meaningful hypothesis about the causes of the problem.Recommend specific actions that will either help you resolve the issue or discover the root cause.

Recommend specific actions that will either help you resolve the issue or discover the root cause.

There are various types of product-execution questions. Below is a list of popular ones:

Product-execution questions are broken down into two categories at a high level:  

Known root cause: the interviewer does have a very specific root cause in mind and would like to see that you are able to discover the root cause by asking the right set of questions and suggest a set of actions to address it.Unknown root cause: the interviewer would like to see that you are  able to come up with a hypothesis on the root cause of the problem and are  able to suggest actions to discover the exact root cause

Product Execution Questions are similar to 20 Questions games in the sense that you have to find the answer by asking the right questions,  the answers of which will guide you to find the final answer you are hoping to provide.



Similar to a 20 Questions exercise, the biggest challenge in Problem  Solving questions is knowing what to ask and which direction to take; so you will have to start by asking a few general questions in the beginning until you find your first hint and start in a specific direction.



The product-execution questions are sometimes phrased as insights that represent recent changes that were made. An example is “The Facebook  Messenger engagement is down 10%. What do you do?”



In other cases, the question is more general and is not tied to a  recent change but it asks you to find out if there can be a product idea for the particular problem that has been highlighted. An example is  “70% of the site users visit the Terms and Conditions of the site. What  would you do?” 



How to answer Product Execution Questions?





Here is a step by step guide/framework, you should follow while answering product-execution interview questions: 



Remember that product execution questions are generally stated as vague statements. This is intentional and is meant to evaluate your ability to find your path as a product manager with that insight.

One tactic that works well in this type of question is asking questions that help you get clarity on the definition of every word in the question. For example, in the “70% of the site users visit the Terms  and Conditions of the site. What would you do?” question, you can ask  “What does a ‘user’ mean? Unique user? First time visitor? A buying  customer?” or “define ‘visit’” and “Does it mean they visited the Terms  and Conditions page and spent x number of seconds on it?”



After you know the definition of every word in the question, start asking questions that give more context around the scope of the problem.  Here are some questions you can ask to help you understand the question better.



Is it device-specific - e.g. mobile vs desktop or both?What does the discussed metric (e.g. usage / visit / user / engagement /etc) mean in this question? How were they measured?Does the change belong to a particular user group, particular location, particular time range (e.g. time of the day or days of the month or week)? - this is very important as it gives you an insight into who has been affected.

The list above is just a sample. Depending on the question, you will have to come up with your own set of questions. 

The answers to the questions will hopefully give you some directions and help you ask more questions about the root cause.



Note that there are two types of root causes at a high level:  internal and external. Here are some examples of internal and external root causes of problems: 

Internal Factors:

Recent product upgrades & bugs & UI changes.A change in the way a metric is measured.Change in marketing campaigns (end of the campaign) or strategies.

Change in marketing campaigns (end of the campaign) or strategies.

External factors:

Another tactic that helps in some questions is breaking down the highlighted metric into simpler modules and asking questions that give you hints about the cause of the problem. For example, in a Profit  Dropping case, you can say that “Profit is made of Revenue and Costs. Do we know if the revenue has dropped or cost has increased?”. 

Once you have an idea of the cause of the problem or think that you have reached a point where the interviewer hints that you have reached the root cause of the problem, you can move to the next step.

Note that sometimes, it’s not clear if you need to go further or can stop with what you have discovered. For example, if the question was  “User engagement has dropped. Figure out why” and you realize that the cause of the drop is a recent upgrade to the software, you can ask the interviewer if they expect you to find the specific change that caused the drop or if they are satisfied with you moving to the next step of providing a hypothesis and suggesting actions. 





The answers to your questions above help you come up with a hypothesis on the root cause of the questions.

If the answers to the questions do not provide sufficient directions for you to know the exact root cause of the issue, it is ok to have multiple hypotheses and share them with the interviewer. In that case,  you can suggest a couple of paths as the potential root causes of the issue. However, in most cases, the interviewer will expect to see that you have come to some conclusion around the cause of the problem. One way to ensure this is the case is by asking the interviewer if they expect you to find a specific root cause or just suggest ways to discover the exact cause.





There are two paths you can take depending on what you have found in your probing. In some cases, your action items will be to investigate further to find the exact root cause (e.g. recent update of an app with a  bug that caused an increase in page loads). For example, if your discovery is that “the recent software upgrade caused the drop”, you can suggest something along the lines of “I suggest to go back to the engineering team and review all changes made. Perhaps look at additional metrics such as “x” and such to determine the exact root case”.

However, if you have discovered the exact cause (e.g. seasonality,  end of the promotion, competitor offering), you might have to make a  recommendation that is more about the reaction to the reality of the change  (e.g. considering offering a competitive service, do nothing since this is due to seasonality, etc).
