You are a PM at Facebook and Facebook has a lot of messaging apps - Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram Chat. Should Facebook consolidate these into one messaging app?





We are thinking of making the changes today when these products already exist and are running in the market or is this decision to be taken at some point in the past?A) Yes, let’s assume we are thinking of making these changes today.Is there any particular reason we are doing this? Like, users are requesting this or any new revenue opportunity that we are thinking of?A) Let’s say Mark Zuckerburg came up to you with this idea and wants your opinion on this.

Company’s Mission and Strategy:



Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.

Hence, combining the messaging apps does help advance that mission and makes it easier for people to collaborate and communicate in a more seamless way.

However, I do have some UX and privacy concerns regarding this, so I would take a few minutes to brainstorm and come up with some factors that would help us decide. 



Comparison based on different factors:



Here are some of the factors I came up with. We will go through the pros and cons of each of the factors and then come up with a recommendation for each of them,





Case: Consolidated App

Pros:It will help users have a more organized conversation instead of a scattered conversation with the same person across different apps.Users will also have fewer apps to manage. Users don’t have to remember where did a particular conversation happen.Cons:Difficult to have multiple streams of conversations in different contexts. Each app has its own user base that caters to different user segments, age groups, usage habits, purpose, etc. Merging them all into one (if not done properly) might lead to a huge churn of users.

Case: Separate Apps 

Pros:Different apps are used for different purposes.Cons:Difficult to remember where a particular conversation happened.Takes users out of context in conversation in different apps.

Pros:

Different apps are used for different purposes.

Different apps are used for different purposes.

Cons:

Difficult to remember where a particular conversation happened.Takes users out of context in conversation in different apps.

Difficult to remember where a particular conversation happened.

Takes users out of context in conversation in different apps.



Decision: Upon weighing the pros and cons of taking Users into consideration, it makes sense to make it a Consolidated App.



Case: Consolidated App

Pros:In case there is one consolidated app, Facebook could drive monetization well in one app to all the user segments of different apps. (WhatsApp isn’t monetized right now, so combining all the users to one app will give rise to a huge revenue opportunity.)Cons:Having one app could drive users away from heavily monetized apps.It also reduces the monetizable surfaces. The more the number of apps, the higher will be the monetization rate.For a consolidated app, in case we fail to monetize it properly, it may drive a large number of users away from the platform.

Pros:

Case: Separate Apps

Pros:In case we decide to monetize all the chat surfaces, there are more monetizable surfaces. The user base is also large and specific to each app and hence the revenue would be more.

Result: Upon weighing the pros and cons of taking Revenue into consideration, it makes sense to keep them as Separate Apps.

Case: Consolidated App

Cons:Users connect across different apps for different purposes. E.g. Users connected on Instagram (business use) might not want to connect on WhatsApp (personal use).If we put all chat data in one place that raises the risk for a larger security and data breach.

Cons:

Case: Separate Apps

Pros:Different apps will let users keep clear and separate profiles in each app which can be used for different purposes.

Pros:

Different apps will let users keep clear and separate profiles in each app which can be used for different purposes.

Result: Upon weighing the pros and cons of taking Privacy into consideration, it makes sense to keep them as Separate Apps.

Case: Consolidated App

Cons:Having a single app for all purposes can increase clutter and users might find it difficult to navigate and use it.Different user experiences, branding, and purpose in different apps.

Case: Separate Apps

Pros:People are used to the current setup of having different chat apps on different platforms.Also, different apps are used for different purposes. e.g. In Instagram, if I share any post, I should be able to instantly like and interact with it, which is different in the case of WhatsApp.

Result: Upon weighing the pros and cons of taking User Experience into consideration, it makes sense to keep them as Separate Apps.

Case: Consolidated App

Cons:A lot of effort will be required to migrate existing data.We will have to create more APIs to cross communicate.A complete UI and UX change would be required.It will raise anti-trust concerns among its users.

Pros:No Effort.

Result: Upon weighing the pros and cons of taking Engineering Effort into consideration, it makes sense to keep them as Separate Apps.

Summary:

We looked at the pros and cons of keeping the chat apps separate and making them consolidated. Even though there are some benefits for users if we create a consolidated app (like having fewer apps to manage and having an organized conversation) but there are too many concerns for us if we plan on consolidating them (like privacy concerns of users and the impact on revenue). Hence I would say I make sense for us to keep them SEPARATED for now. We should evaluate, is there any compelling use case towards doing this, and is there any other way to achieve this without having to merge all the apps.
