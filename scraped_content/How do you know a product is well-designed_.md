Dieter Rams is a famous industrial designer who has deeply influenced Apple’s design chief, Jonathan Ive. Rams has 10 design principles that govern his work. It serves as a good starting point to evaluate the product or feature design. 







A Good design is: 



Innovative - For anyone to be interested in your product, it has to be innovative, and it has to be innovative in a way that will connect with consumers

Makes a product useful - A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic.

Aesthetic - The look and feel of a product are just as central to good design as functionality.

Understandable - It can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user's intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.

Unobtrusive - Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools and are neither decorative objects nor works of art.

Long-lasting - Long-lasting products are more valuable to consumers and better for the planet.

Thorough down to the last detail - Nothing must be arbitrary. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.

Environmentally friendly - Good design should make an important contribution to the preservation of the environment by conserving resources and minimizing physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

As little design as possible - Simple as possible but not simpler. Users need to be able to quickly and intuitively understand how a product is supposed to work.

A good design according to me would be that,

Looks Simple.Easily Understandable by the users (like, Users should be able to complete the journey without any external help)and Makes the product Useful and Innovative.

and Makes the product Useful and Innovative.



A follow-up question to that would be:



Can you give some examples of well-designed products?
