Interview Tip: Ask Clarifying Questions to understand the scope of the problem.



Q) What is the Time Frame we should consider - Daily, Monthly, Yearly?

A) Let’s consider, it on a Monthly basis.

Q) Does it include salons for men, women, or both?

A) Consider salons only for men.

Q) Since, prices vary between urban and rural salons, any particular area to focus on?

A) For this question, let consider salons in the Urban area.



So, now the questions turned out to be,

How much does a men’s salon owner in an urban area make in India per month?



Assumptions, 

Number of Customers on Weekdays in a salon be 15 (Checked it with a nearby salon)Number of Customers on Weekends in a salon be 30 (Since people are usually free on weekends)

Number of Customers on Weekdays in a salon be 15 (Checked it with a nearby salon)

Number of Customers on Weekends in a salon be 30 (Since people are usually free on weekends)

Assumed Rates:

Let the average Haircut rate be Rs.80 (since, we considered urban area)Let the average Beard Grooming/Shaving be Rs.40

Let the average Haircut rate be Rs.80 (since, we considered urban area)

Let the average Beard Grooming/Shaving be Rs.40



So, let the average spending per person be Rs.100(Since not every person does both Haircut & Shaving)

Some salon offer many more services (e.g. massage, facial), but we are excluding them as that number is very low and can be ignored.



Total number of working days at a salon, (1 day off per week)

= (31 - 4) 

= 27 working days.



Of these 27 days, there are 19 weekdays and 8 weekends.



Revenue generated = (Number of people) x (Cost) x (Days)

Therefore, 

Revenue on Weekdays = 15 x 100 x 19 = Rs. 28,500

Revenue on Weekends = 30 x 100 x 8 = Rs. 24,000



Total Revenue = Rs (28,500 + 24,000) = Rs. 52,500 per month

Now, lets calculate Expenses at a Salon,

Rent = Rs. 8,000Electricity = Rs. 2000Salon product expenses = Rs. 5000Staff Salary - Rs. 8000 per person.Assuming only 2 people operating the salon. (one of which can be the owner)

Rent = Rs. 8,000

Electricity = Rs. 2000

Salon product expenses = Rs. 5000

Staff Salary - Rs. 8000 per person.Assuming only 2 people operating the salon. (one of which can be the owner)



Total Expense = Rs. (8000 + 2000 + 5000 + 8000) = Rs. 23000



Net profit that the salon owner makes, 

= 52500 - 23000 

~ Rs. 29,500 per month
