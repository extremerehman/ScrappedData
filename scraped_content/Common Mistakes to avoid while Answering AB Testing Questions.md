Here is a list of common mistakes which people make while answering product AB Testing questions:



The goal of AB testing questions is to evaluate your ability to incrementally improve the product with small tweaks. You are not expected to think of ideas that are difficult or take too long to implement. If the idea takes a lot of resources to implement, it is more suitable for a product improvement question. Consider easy-to-implement changes that you can do in a week or less (e.g., changes in colors,  font size, placement of certain messages, etc.). 



If you miss highlighting the tradeoffs with your AB test, the interviewer will conclude that you will not take into account the consequences of your product decisions in other parts of the product.  This is usually a red flag to the interviewer. 



Many AB test results discourage the product manager to move ahead with the change they built a hypothesis around. They realize that even though the change resulted in a positive impact on the metric they were hoping to improve, it negatively impacted other parts of the product.

One example can be a change that increases the number of sign-ups but reduces the number of activations. A good answer to an AB testing question will include the metrics and criteria of success that carefully monitor the overall impact of the change. This approach ensures that you are carefully measuring the overall impact of the proposed tweak on the product and the business as a whole.
