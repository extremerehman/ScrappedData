Here is a list of common mistakes which people make while answering problem-solving questions:



One of the common mistakes that the PM candidates make is that they skip asking clarification questions that help them understand the problem statement better. There is a lot of valuable information you can get by asking questions that help you understand the problem statement better. For example, if the question is referring to a drop in usage,  engagement, users, traffic, a good place to start is to ask some questions around the definition of the particular metric that has dropped.





It’s a huge mistake to jump into solving a problem and suggesting solutions without knowing the cause of the problem. For example, if the question was “There are 1 million inactive Spotify users. What would you do about them?”, you might be tempted to answer this question by suggesting ways to engage this group of users via promotions, emails,  etc. The problem with this approach is that you are solving the problem without knowing the root cause of the problem. Perhaps, there is  not even a solution (e.g. what if these are dead people?)

A better approach would be to first understand what the interviewer means by “inactive”, and “users” and also discover the root cause of the inactivity before suggesting solutions. Only after having a good understanding of the cause of the problem (user inactivity), you should consider offering solutions to the problem.

You can lose valuable insight by not thinking about the user journey of the problem that experienced the drop. In many problem-solving questions, you thinking about the user journey gives you some hints about the questions to ask as user journey usually reflects information about the product touchpoints, its connection to other products,  services, or user activities that might have caused the drop. 

For example, if there is a significant drop in user sign-up, it helps to think about what the user sign up for the particular product entails from a user journey perspective. Some things you’d like to explore are :  

How does a user end up on the signup page?Where are the beginning and end of the signup process?What dependencies does a signup flow have?

How does a user end up on the signup page?

Where are the beginning and end of the signup process?

What dependencies does a signup flow have?

The answers to the above questions will hopefully give you a good overview of the causes of the problem.



There could be so many reasons that a problem appears in a product. A  mistake that some PM interview candidates make is they don’t take a  systematic approach in diagnosing the problem and listing out categories of causes. Instead, they get very tactical and ask questions that only reveal if a particular potential root cause was the reason for the problem. Instead, start by asking more general questions first to narrow down the scope as much as possible. Questions that help you disregard a large group of options are great. Examples are:

Was this change sudden or overtime?Did it belong to a particular geographical location? Was this other metric (e.g. sign up, # of activities per x, etc) were impacted?
