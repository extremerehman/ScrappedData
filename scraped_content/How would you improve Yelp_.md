### Describe the Product

To start off in the right direction, you need to explain your understanding of the product – what does it do, who uses it, and how.



Yelp is a popular online platform that allows users to search for and review local businesses. The platform was founded in 2004 and has since grown to become one of the most popular local business review sites in the world. Yelp is available for free on a wide range of platforms, including web browsers, iOS and Android mobile apps.

The main goal of Yelp is to help users find local businesses and services that meet their needs. The platform allows users to search for businesses by category, location, and keyword, and provides them with detailed information about each business, including reviews, photos, and contact information. Yelp also provides a platform for users to write and read reviews about local businesses, which helps others make informed decisions about where to spend their money.

One of the main features of Yelp is its user-generated reviews. Users can write reviews about local businesses they have visited, and these reviews can be read by other users. Reviews can be sorted by most recent, most helpful, and highest-rated, which makes it easy for users to find the most relevant reviews. Yelp also allows users to post photos and videos, which provide a more detailed view of the business.

Yelp also allows businesses to claim their profiles and respond to reviews. This feature allows businesses to manage their online reputation and interact with their customers in a more direct way. Businesses can also add photos, videos, and other details to their profiles, which helps them stand out to potential customers.

Yelp also offers a range of other features, such as the ability to make reservations and order delivery or takeout. These features make it easy for users to find the perfect restaurant or service and make a reservation or order without leaving the platform.

Another important feature of Yelp is its ability to integrate with other platforms. For example, Yelp can be integrated with Google Maps, which allows users to find businesses on a map and see reviews, photos, and other details. Yelp can also be integrated with other social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, which allows users to share their reviews and photos with their friends and followers.

Yelp is also a great tool for businesses. It helps businesses to get discovered by potential customers who are looking for products and services in their area. Yelp also provides businesses with valuable data and insights, such as customer reviews, ratings, and demographics, which can help them improve their products and services.

In conclusion, Yelp is a powerful and versatile platform that has revolutionized the way people find and review local businesses. With its user-generated reviews, detailed business information, and range of features, Yelp has become a popular choice among users around the world. The platform also provides businesses with valuable data and insights, which can help them improve their products and services. Yelp's integration with other platforms, such as Google Maps and social media, also makes it easy for users to find and share information about local businesses. Overall, Yelp is a valuable tool for both consumers and businesses alike.

To improve retention of Home Services, it is essential to enhance the value proposition of the feature to users. To achieve this, we need to comprehend their goals and key needs that need to be met more effectively.

They are tech-savvy and utilize the internet to gather information. When searching for professional help, they aim to find the most suitable service providers and place a service request quickly. As a result, they want to have confidence in the reviews of other Yelp users, make a rapid decision on a service provider, and place an order for the service. In summary, the user goal is to quickly find and contact reliable service providers.
