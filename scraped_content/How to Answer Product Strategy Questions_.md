### Why are Product Strategy Questions asked?

Product strategy questions are an essential part of a product management interview. The interviewer asks these questions to evaluate the candidate's skills in assessing various strategic paths for a product or company and making informed decisions about the path forward. Here are some reasons why product strategy questions are asked in a product management interview:

1. Assess structured thinking process: Product strategy questions are designed to evaluate the candidate's ability to think in a structured manner when dealing with abstract situations. The interviewer wants to know if the candidate can develop a logical approach to problem-solving and decision-making.
2. Understand company's strengths and weaknesses: Product strategy questions also aim to assess the candidate's understanding of the company's strengths and weaknesses. The interviewer wants to know if the candidate has researched the company and can identify areas where the company excels or needs improvement.

5. Make meaningful executive decisions: Lastly, product strategy questions aim to assess the candidate's ability to make meaningful executive decisions that consider all the key aspects of the decision.

To prepare effectively for a product strategy interview, it's important to understand how to approach the different types of questions that may come up. Let's take a closer look at each point in detail:

#### 1. Clarify the Question

The first step in tackling any question is to clarify the scope of the problem. Sometimes, the question may already be specific enough that you can proceed without further clarification, e.g. Should Facebook have a dating feature? . However, in cases where the question is too broad, it's important to ask for clarification to ensure that you understand what is being asked. For example, if the question is "What should be the product strategy of Company X moving forward?" you might ask, "Are we talking about the overall product portfolio or a specific product within the portfolio?" or "What are the key metrics that we should be considering when defining its product strategy?"

Asking these types of clarifying questions can help you understand the scope of the problem and ensure that you are addressing the right issues. It's also important to ask questions about the current status of the company and the product, such as "WHY is the company considering a shift in strategy?" or "What are the current pain points that users are experiencing with the product?" Understanding these key details can help you prioritize the right strategy.

Note that the interviewer may sometimes respond by giving you more freedom to choose the path to move forward. In this case, it's important to take a step back and think critically about what the company's missions and goals are and what you believe is the best approach to achieve those goals. Ultimately, the goal is to demonstrate that you can think creatively and strategically about product problems and come up with effective solutions.
