By top-of-the-funnel activities do you mean awareness or acquisition?



A) Awareness.

Do you have a particular product in mind? I ask because the type of channels to use will depend on who the customers are and where to find them.



A) Use a product you know to illustrate your thought process.





Okay, I will use Duolingo as an example. Here are the general steps I use to select the best channels to raise awareness:

Understand the customers. I would try to understand who the customers are as well as their goals and needs concerning the product.Understand the context. I would discover where and when can we reach the customers with a targeted message?List channels. I would make a list of the channels that could be used to reach them at the most appropriate moments.Prioritize the channels. I would pick the channels that are likely to produce the best ROI.Set goals. I would define awareness metrics and set goals to help evaluate how the channels performed.Evaluate the channels. I would compare the channels regarding performance on awareness metrics and double down on the best-performing channels. After exhausting the first channels, I would start testing the rest of the channels to fill the pipeline.

I would like to illustrate now how I would apply this process to Duolingo.



About Duolingo



Duolingo is a popular language learning app that is available on both iOS and Android platforms. It is a free, gamified, and interactive way of learning a new language. Duolingo was founded in 2011 by Luis von Ahn, a computer science professor, and Severin Hacker, a graduate student. The app's mission is to make education free and accessible to all, and it has been downloaded over 300 million times worldwide.

Duolingo offers a wide range of languages to learn, including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and many others. The app uses a variety of interactive methods to teach the language, including reading, listening, writing, and speaking exercises. The app also uses a unique gamification method to make learning fun and engaging. Users are awarded points and badges as they progress through the lessons, and they can compete with friends to see who can learn the most words in a day.

Duolingo's approach to language learning is based on research in cognitive science. The app's lessons are designed to target specific areas of the brain responsible for language learning, and they are tailored to the individual's learning style. The app also uses a spaced repetition method, which means that the user will be exposed to a word or phrase multiple times in order to help it stick in their memory.

Duolingo also offers a feature called "Duolingo for Schools" which allows teachers to create a class and track the progress of their students. The teachers can also set goals for their students and assign specific lessons. This feature makes Duolingo a great tool for educators looking to incorporate language learning into their curriculum.



Customers and Context



The first step is to understand the customers and their context. I would start by asking questions such as: 

Why do people want to use Duolingo? When and where would they use the platform? What are the users thinking? What are they feeling in those moments? 

Why do people want to use Duolingo? 

When and where would they use the platform? 

What are the users thinking? 

What are they feeling in those moments? 

Answers to these questions will help identify where we can reach them, when is the most appropriate time, and what message to convey to pique their interest.



So, let’s start by listing who the likely users are:

Students. Students from public schools, universities, or language schools who are taking classes to learn a second language. They have time and are already motivated to learn.Professionals. Salespeople, consultants, or business people who travel abroad frequently. These professionals may want to learn basic conversational skills in a second language.People who are moving to another country. People who are moving abroad for an extended period of time, for example, students in an exchange program, or professionals moving abroad on assignment. Learning the language of the host country would be a top priority for most of these users.Hobbyists. These are people going on vacation or holidays that want to learn basic phrases to get by, like ordering food at a restaurant or taking a taxi. They are occasional users who are not committed to continuous learning.Immigrants. Adults that immigrate to a new country for economic or political reasons do not usually speak the host country’s language. However, they feel the need to learn the language, but don’t have the time or resources to attend a language school.

I think the best users to target would be those that already have an interest in learning a language out of necessity. Either because they are traveling abroad, or they need to learn a second language for school, or are already taking a foreign language class and want to improve. Therefore, I think that students and professionals fit these criteria best.

Channels

Now, I would like to go deeper into analyzing the context in which these users would need Duolingo. Knowing why they need help in learning a language, and where and when will help identify which channels to use to reach them. Let’s start with students.

Students who are already learning a second language at school, university or language school will invariably need help with grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The first place they would go to for help is the Internet. So organic search such as SEO or search ads would be good channels to reach them. I would do keyword analysis to find out the most frequent words and phrases they use for their searches, and use those words in Duolingo’s site. To grab their attention more strongly, I would also design search ads to include the same words they used in their search. For example, if they are searching for resources to help them with grammar, a display ad should emphasize how Duolingo can improve their grammar skills.Amazon is another venue where students may look for language learning resources such as books or audiobooks. Display advertising on Amazon pages related to language learning tools would be another channel option.Language teachers are always looking for better ways to help students practice their language skills. Email campaigns could be used to raise awareness with teachers.Schools, Universities or language schools usually have exchange programs for students to spend a summer or a year abroad. Partnering with schools to raise awareness with students in exchange programs is another channel.Certification or diplomas from different language organizations are sometimes prerequisites for students applying to universities in a different country. For example, the TOEFL certification is required from foreign students to apply to American colleges or universities. A partnership with such an organization would be an excellent channel to bring awareness of Duolingo.

Let’s explore contexts in which professionals could be reached opportunistically with ads:

Driving. Outdoor advertising such as billboards along highways would be a good channel.Airports. Location-aware mobile ads or digital signage in terminals could remind people of their desire to improve their language skills before traveling abroad.Hotel rooms. Once abroad, users might need help with translation. Hotels are good places for Duolingo to have digital signage ads with QR codes or location-aware mobile ads to download the app.Restaurants. Users traveling abroad will find themselves in situations like looking for directions, ordering food or using a taxi. During these moments location-aware mobile ads within other apps such as Waze, Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor, WeatherChannel, or Foursquare could be used.Commuter trains. In Asian countries, reading street signs and using transportation is challenging. Having an app to help translate and pronounce words would rescue many travelers. Again, location-aware mobile ads and digital signage ads in widely used stations are good channels to use.Travel reservations. Reaching users while they are making travel reservations would be a good moment to remind them of Duolingo. Showing display ads on travel websites like Travelocity or Expedia and partnerships with enterprise travel services like Concur could be good channels to raise awareness.

Let me summarize all the channels for Students and Professionals with a table.

One channel I have not talked about is referrals. Referrals are one of the most important channels for any application to raise awareness and Duolingo has used it effectively. Every time Duolingo users accomplish something, like translating a sentence correctly, completing a learning streak or passing a test, they are invited to share their accomplishments with friends. I would treat referrals as a special channel because it is also part of the UX experience and design of the product, which is out of scope for this question. 

Prioritization

There are too many channels to try, so I need to prioritize. My criteria would be to choose first those channels that are more likely to grab the user’s attention, are quick to implement and not too costly. To gain the user’s attention, the user must be in a situation where he or she is already thinking about learning or improving their skills in a second language. And I think organic search, search ads, and location-aware mobile ads fit these criteria. The act of searching for resources to learn a language implies intention and interest, so organic and paid search ads are good channels to capture a user’s attention at that moment. And, with location-aware technology, Duolingo ads can be precisely displayed when users are thinking about getting help with a foreign language. For example at airports or when they have arrived to their hotels in a different country. Regarding speed to implement and cost, these three channels outweigh the others.

Goals

In order to evaluate the performance of the chosen channels, it is important to set goals. Duolingo is already doing a fantastic job in SEO. So, I would use their SEO metrics as a base reference for search ads and location-aware mobile ads. Search ads and location-aware mobile ads are only worth paying for if they outperform SEO. For example, the total number of downloads or the total number of new visitors to the app page in the App Store due to search ad and location-aware ads should outperform SEO efforts. I would also segment these metrics by location (countries) to identify which countries perform the best.

While exhausting the prioritized channels, I would also run small tests with the rest of the channels to preselect them. This way, I can include them in the pipeline.

Summary

In summary, I described a process for selecting the best channels to raise awareness. And applied this process to Duolingo as an example. In a nutshell, the process includes understanding the customers, selecting the best channels, setting metrics and goals, evaluating metrics, doubling down on the best channels, and continue putting new channels in the pipeline. 

For Duolingo, I recommended targeting Students learning a second language and Professionals traveling abroad. Based on my analysis, search ads and location-aware ads are the best channels to reach them when they need help with a second language. While the preferred channels are being exhausted, the rest of the channels can be pre-tested to include them in the pipeline. I also mentioned referrals as another important awareness channel to keep in mind. But, since referrals are tied to product design, it would require a different type of analysis that I am happy to discuss if you like me to.
