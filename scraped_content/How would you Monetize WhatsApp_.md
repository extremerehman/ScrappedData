“WhatsApp is a widely used cross-platform messaging app that allows users to communicate with each other in a variety of ways.

## Step 3: Define the Goals

The mission of WhatsApp is to “connect the world privately by designing a product that's simple and private”, which resonates with the overall Facebook mission of connecting people and communities to bring the world closer together.

WhatsApp already has a large, highly active, and engaged user base. However, monetization has been a persistent challenge for the platform.

Also, to ensure the long-term viability of the platform and stay ahead of its competitors, it needs to generate revenue to cover operational costs, fund new innovative features, and maintain infrastructure.

Mention your approach -

“Now that we have defined the goals for this problem, I will go ahead and list down the user segments for this product, followed by the pain points these users are facing, prioritizing them, and coming up with a prioritized list of solutions and metrics that we will track to identify its success.”

## Step 4: List the User Segments



WhatsApp is used by a wide variety of user groups and across many geographies.

We can broadly categorise the user segments into,

* Consumers -This is the largest and the most active user segment, which uses WhatsApp for regular personal communication, engaging in groups, sharing content, etc.
* This is the largest and the most active user segment, which uses WhatsApp for regular personal communication, engaging in groups, sharing content, etc.
* Businesses -This segment of users/companies uses WhatsApp to engage with their clients for sales and support.
* This segment of users/companies uses WhatsApp to engage with their clients for sales and support.

Consumers -

Businesses -

* This segment of users/companies uses WhatsApp to engage with their clients for sales and support.

This segment of users/companies uses WhatsApp to engage with their clients for sales and support.

For the purpose of this question, I will consider the Consumer segment who mostly use WhatsApp for their personal use.

The consumer segment can be further broken down into,

* Students (age ~ 15 to 24) - Highly active user segment and Mostly uses the app to have call/text conversations with friends, family, and classmates regarding academic or personal topics.
* Working professionals (age ~ 25 to 55) - Highly active user segment and Likes to use WhatsApp to stay connected with their family, friends, and colleagues. Particularly during working hours, use the app for crucial on-the-job-related messaging. May also have a confidential conversation with a client/customer/colleague.
* Elderly people (age ~55+) - Usually less active and Mostly use the app to have call/text conversations with other family members and relatives.

Students (age ~ 15 to 24) - Highly active user segment and Mostly uses the app to have call/text conversations with friends, family, and classmates regarding academic or personal topics.

Working professionals (age ~ 25 to 55) - Highly active user segment and Likes to use WhatsApp to stay connected with their family, friends, and colleagues. Particularly during working hours, use the app for crucial on-the-job-related messaging. May also have a confidential conversation with a client/customer/colleague.

Elderly people (age ~55+) - Usually less active and Mostly use the app to have call/text conversations with other family members and relatives.

Now, Select your user group and state your reason for the same. -

“For the scope of this question, I plan to go ahead with the Student segment (Gen Z users), as this segment of users is very large in number who are always looking for new ways to communicate effectively with their friends and family.

If we can solve the pain points of these users and help them engage more, then that would increase user engagement, retention and revenue as well.

## Step 5: List down the user Pain Points
