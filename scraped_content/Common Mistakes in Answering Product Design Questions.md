Here is a list of common mistakes which people make while answering product design questions:





It’s easy to jump into answering a question after hearing it. A  better approach is to narrow down the scope of the question by first asking a few clarification questions. As a general rule of thumb, ask at least two clarification questions before you start answering the question.



The interviewers do not expect you to build a product that works for everybody. List the user groups that you think are relevant and then pick one particular user group as the user group that you’d like to focus on. 





The interviewer likes to see you take a minute before talking about the pain points and also the solutions. It shows that you are thoughtful and don’t jump into making decisions without evaluating your options and understanding the bigger picture. Without taking a minute to write down your ideas on paper, you may end up jumping into a solution that you realize halfway through answering that it would not be feasible.  When you write your ideas or pain points on paper, you also give yourself a chance to cross out the bad ones before sharing them with the interviewer. 



You cannot solve all the pain points during the interview. After you list the pain points, evaluate and prioritize them based on your evaluation criteria. This evaluation criterion helps you to be focused during your brainstorming phase as your solutions are targeted towards solving the problems you’ve prioritized.



The interviewers want to evaluate your ability to come up with novel solutions for the problems you’ve come up with. Only listing obvious solutions to a problem that you’ve highlighted might make the interviews think that you cannot think outside the box. Don’t be shy about listing a couple of creative solutions. As soon as you have proper evaluation criteria to eliminate creative solutions that are hard to build, you don’t have to worry about listing ideas that are not easy to build.  

If you skip evaluating and prioritizing your ideas, you are hinting to the interviewer that you will not be good at execution and will attempt to build too many things at the same time. Showcase your ability to stay focused by selecting a set of meaningful criteria to evaluate your solutions again and prioritize them accordingly.
