## Why are Product Design Questions asked?

Product Design Interview Questions are asked in order to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically and creatively when designing new products. These questions are used to assess a candidate's ability to:

1. Develop a structured thought process when faced with ambiguous or uncertain conditions. This includes the ability to understand and analyze customer needs, identify pain points, and develop solutions that align with the goals of the product.
2. Identify and evaluate pain points in the customer journey. This includes understanding the customer's needs, wants, and frustrations, and developing solutions that address these pain points.
3. Utilize creativity and imagination to design new products that are practical, usable, and innovative. This includes the ability to think outside the box, come up with unique solutions, and iterate on designs based on feedback.
4. Estimate the implementation efforts and costs associated with the design. This includes understanding the resources and skills required to bring the product to market, and the costs associated with development, testing, and deployment.

“Google Maps is a widely used navigation product that allows users to easily navigate from one point to another. It provides a variety of commute options, including driving, walking, and public transportation, and gives users the exact route, traffic conditions, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and the shortest path to travel between the two points.

In addition to providing navigation services, Google Maps also allows users to search for nearby places such as restaurants, gas stations, events, tourist areas, and things to do. This feature makes it easy for users to find and explore new places, and plan their trips accordingly.

Google Maps is also a platform that allows other businesses to access its maps through an application programming interface (API). This allows businesses to build additional features and services for their customers, such as location-based services, route optimization, and real-time traffic updates.

Google Maps is accessible from a desktop web, mobile web, and mobile app (Android & IOS). This makes it easy for users to access the service from any device, whether they are at home or on the go.

Google Maps has many competitors in the market, including Bing Maps, Here WeGo, MapQuest, Maps.me, etc. However, Google Maps is the most popular navigation product in the market, with billions of users worldwide. It's widely used for its features that are easy to use, accurate, up-to-date and it's also a platform for businesses to build on top of it.

Now that we are clear on the product description and the interviewer is also onboarded.

Let’s move on to the next step: Ask Clarifying Questions.

You: “Before we move on, I have a few clarifying questions I want to ask. Shall I proceed?”

## Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions



Q1) Is the parking solution intended to be a core feature integrated directly into Google Maps, or a separate app/service that works alongside it?

A) Yes, this service would be a part of Google maps.

Q2) Should the solution focus on a specific type of parking (e.g., public street parking, private lots, residential areas), or should it cover all types?

A) Upto you to decide.

Q3) Are there specific user segments (e.g., commuters, tourists, business owners) that we should prioritize in this solution?

A) Upto you to decide.

Q4) Should we focus more on the supply side (parking space owners) or the demand side (drivers seeking parking)?

A) Upto you to decide.

Q5) Are there particular regions, cities, or countries where this solution should be launched first, or is it intended for a global rollout?

A) Consider it to be first launched only in India.

Q6) Should we consider different parking regulations, behaviors, or challenges that vary by location?

A) For the scope of this question you can consider them to be constant.

Q7) Are there any existing partnerships or contracts with parking providers that could affect the solution?

A) No.

Q8) Are we focusing on any particular platform like desktop web or mobile app (IOS, Android)?

A) It will be launched for all platforms.



## Step 3: Define the Goals

The primary goal of introducing a parking solution is to enhance the engagement and monetisation opportunities of Google Maps. By integrating parking features, we can:

1. Increase user satisfaction and retention by providing a seamless parking experience.
2. Gather valuable data on user behaviour, which can improve ad targeting and monetization strategies.
3. Create new revenue streams through partnerships with parking space providers and enhanced Google Pay functionalities.

#### Focus Segment:

Supply Side - Individual Home or Spot Owners

Although we have identified both demand and supply side user segments for Google Maps, focusing on the supply side is more crucial. With an already large user base, demand is likely to follow naturally if Google can create a robust ecosystem that balances both supply and demand.

Currently Individual Home or Spot Owners is the most underserved market compared to other parking supply providers, which are already kind of overserved.



## Step 6: Pain Points

Here are some of the pain points of the Individual Parking Spot owners category:

1. Many homeowners are unaware of the potential to monetize their unused parking spaces.
2. Users are not sure how would they reach out to more people looking for empty parking spots and get more recurring parking space bookings.
3. Users are uncertainty about how to price their parking spaces competitively while still making a profit and how to collect payments automatically.
4. Users are not sure how to manage access (allow for a certain time / deny / revoke) to their parking spots.
5. Users are not able to trust strangers and are worried about the security of the parking space (theft, intrusion, vandalism, damage to property or inappropriate behavior etc.)
