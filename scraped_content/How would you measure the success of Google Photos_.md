Answer

Describe the Product

Google Photos is a web and mobile app that allows users to upload, store, edit, and share photos, videos, and GIFs (collectively referred to as "media"). Users can create albums of media and share them with others, as well as cast them to compatible devices. Google Photos also offers an app and desktop uploader to facilitate transferring media from devices to the app. In addition, Google Photos utilizes AI technology to perform face recognition and create composite photos in the form of animations and collages. The service has already attracted over a billion users, though it does not have a clear revenue model as storage is free with the use of the high-quality setting and purchasing physical items like prints, books, and mugs is infrequent.

Goal



Acquisition: With over 1 billion existing users, acquisition is not likely the primary goal.Revenue: As mentioned previously, the current monetization model does not prioritize generating revenue.Retention and Engagement: These two goals are closely linked, as engaged users are more likely to continue using the service. It is important to ensure that users are actively interacting with the app and not just uploading and forgetting about their media.Market Share: Google Photos faces competition from other popular social sharing platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as storage services like iCloud. However, it may have an advantage as a storage platform that can facilitate social sharing. Microsoft Photos does not appear to have a significant market share compared to Google Photos.Customer Satisfaction: While customer satisfaction is important, it can be inferred through engagement and retention rates.

Daily, weekly, and monthly active users (DAU, WAU, MAU) - This metric reflects the overall level of engagement with the app and can be correlated with the number of photos viewed. If this metric decreases, it may indicate retention issues.Number of photos uploaded per day, week, or month - As photos and videos are the primary source of content for the app and form the basis for all engagement, it is important for Google to focus on growing this metric. An increase in photo and video uploads can lead to growth in views, shares, and edits.Percentage of users who share photos - This metric is a good overall indicator of adoption and can bring new users into the ecosystem. By focusing on increasing the percentage of users who share photos, Google can continue to expand its user base and drive engagement.
