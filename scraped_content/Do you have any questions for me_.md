Interest in the job

When you ask questions it simply conveys that you’re interested in the job and not giving the interview for the sake of it.



Lasting impression

Your questions can leave a great impression on the interviewers as much as so, that it might become the deciding factor in being selected for the role.



To see if you have researched the company

If you don't have any interview questions to ask the employer, or you ask a series of very generic questions, it will indicate that you don’t know a whole lot about the company.







Your questions should make it clear that you were engaged during the interview and have quickly gained a sense of the company's goals and priorities. 

Tip: Aim to always ask open-ended questions, and not questions that can be answered with a "yes" or "no."

Here are a few sample questions to ask the hiring manager,



(At the beginning of the interview process)



Can you tell me more about the Hiring Process?Can you tell me more about the role?Can you tell me more about the Company? (it’s better to research about the company before applying)

Tip: It’s okay to say “I don’t have any questions for now” rather than asking a very obvious question or questions like these - 



Off-work activities: Stay away from queries that are focused on non-work activities,  like happy hour outings, lunch, or vacation time. Similarly, don't ask how many hours you'll need to work each day. The interviewer's personal life or office gossip: Give  interviewers the same courtesy you'd want them to give to you by not  asking about their family, living situation, or gossip about people you  may both know.Things you could answer yourself: If your question could be easily answered with a quick online search or by glancing at the company website, skip it. Time-wasting questions won't be appreciated. Salary and benefits: If it's a first-round interview,  getting specific about salary and benefits can make you seem uninterested in the work and the company, and focused only on yourself.  Very complicated or multi-part questions: Asking multi-part questions can overwhelm interviewers. Ask just one question at a time. You can always follow up. Aim to make the moment feel conversational.
