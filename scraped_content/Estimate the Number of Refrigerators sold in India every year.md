Q) Are we considering Refrigerators for both Domestic & Commercial use?

A) Let’s consider, domestic use only.





Known: The population of India ~ 1.3 Billion



Assumption - 

Let the number of members in a household in India be 4.(taking into consideration both Urban and Rural India)



Therefore, 

Number of Households in India,

= (1300 / 4 ) million

= 325 million

Assumption - 



Let’s assume the percentage of Poor : Middle : Rich class for, 



Metro / Tier 1 households -  20% : 60% : 20%Tier 2 / Tier 3 households -  40% : 50% : 10%Village  households - 60% : 38% : 2%

Metro / Tier 1 households -  20% : 60% : 20%

Tier 2 / Tier 3 households -  40% : 50% : 10%

Village  households - 60% : 38% : 2%

Assumption -



Let’s assume the Market Penetration of Refigerators in India be,









Absolute Number of Refridgerators ,

= Number of household in each segment x Sum of market penetration







Total number of Refrigerator = 32 +30 +16 = 78 million

People buying due to replacement.

People buying for the first time.



Let’s take the average life of Refrigerator = 10 years

Assumed Growth rate = 5%





Refrigerator sold in a year in India,

= 7.8 +3.9

~ 11.7 million
