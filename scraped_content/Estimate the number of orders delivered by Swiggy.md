In product management interviews, it is common for interviewers to pose product estimation questions. These questions are designed to assess a candidate's ability to estimate various metrics, such as revenue, cost, and the number of users, for a given product. The ability to estimate these metrics is crucial for product managers, as it enables them to make informed decisions about the product and its development.

Guess-estimation is a critical skill for product managers when it comes to estimating the revenue of a product, the size of a new market, the cost of running a product, and the revenue or growth potential of a new business opportunity. It also helps in convincing stakeholders about a new product idea and its prioritization in the roadmap. By using guess-estimation techniques, product managers can make informed decisions that are based on data and analysis, rather than on guesswork or intuition.

To effectively answer product estimation questions during a product management interview, it is important to keep in mind the following points:

Communicate in a structured way: When explaining your estimation approach, it is crucial to do so in a structured manner. This will help the interviewer follow your thought process and understand how you arrived at your estimates.Confirm understanding: It is also essential to ensure that the interviewer is on the same page with your calculations and approach. You can do this by asking clarifying questions or summarizing your approach to confirm their understanding.Explain assumptions and rationale: Providing context to your estimates is critical to demonstrate your ability to estimate various metrics. Therefore, it is important to explain your assumptions and the reasoning behind them to give context to your calculations.Use an estimation tree: Estimation trees are a useful tool to break down complex calculations into smaller, more manageable parts. By first explaining the logic behind your operations and then focusing solely on the calculations, you can make it easier for the interviewer to follow your thought process and gain a better understanding of your estimation approach.

Answer Structure:

To answer product estimation interview questions effectively, you can follow the following step-by-step framework:

Ask Clarifying Questions: Begin by asking the interviewer clarifying questions to remove any ambiguity and narrow the scope of the question. This helps you to better understand what they are asking and what factors you should consider.Create an Equation: Based on the information provided and your assumptions, create an equation that represents the problem at hand. Be sure to take into account any edge cases and data sources that may affect your calculations.Break Down the Equation: Break down the equation into its various components and explain each one in detail, including the assumptions you have made for each component. This helps the interviewer to understand how you arrived at each part of the equation.Calculate Each Component: Calculate each component of the equation to arrive at the final result. Be sure to show your work and walk the interviewer through your calculations.Do a Sanity Check: Finally, do a sanity check of your equation, assumptions, and calculations. Ask yourself if the result makes sense based on your understanding of the problem and the information provided. If necessary, adjust your calculations or assumptions and re-check your work.

1. Ask Clarifying Questions

Q) Is there a specific region in India that we are focused on?A) We are interested in the entire country.Q) When we mention orders, are we referring to successful food orders only, or does it also include other services provided by Swiggy, such as groceries? A) We are only concerned with successful food orders..Q) Are we observing a specific platform for placing orders?A) We are only considering orders placed through smartphones.Q) As Swiggy usage can vary from day to day, can we look at an average day scenario?A) Yes, that is acceptable..

2. About the Product:



Swiggy is an online food delivery platform that allows customers to order food from restaurants in their local area using its mobile application or website. The platform has a vast network of delivery personnel who pick up food from restaurants and deliver it to customers' doorsteps in a timely and efficient manner.

Its product offering includes, Food Delivery, Groceries Delivery, Dineout Booking, Parcel Delivery, Meat Delivery.

Some of the competitors of Swiggy are, Zomato, UberEats, Dunzo, Food Panda, etc.



3. Make an Equation:

Number of Orders delivered by Swiggy = [(Number of food delivery app users * Market Share of Swiggy) * Avg. Number of orders made per month by a customer]



4. Breakdown of Equation: 

The population of India is 1.3 Billion

The distribution of the population in urban and rural areas is 30 : 70.

The avg. population in the top 1-5 cities (5 cities) - 15 Million.  (Approx)Food delivery app penetration here - 25% (Assumption)The avg. population of top 6-10 cities (5 cities) - 8 Million (Approx)Food delivery app penetration here - 10% (Assumption)Total food delivery app users in metros,

= 15 * 5 * 0.25 + 8 * 5 * 0.1 + 5 

= 27.75 Million



Adding 5M more users from smaller cities in India, (Assumption)

Hence, the total food delivery app users 

= 27.75 + 5 

= 32.75 Million

Assuming the percentage of users who order,

Monthly - 50% (i.e. 1 delivery per month)Bi-monthly - 30% (i.e. 2 deliveries per month)Weekly - 15% (i.e. 4 deliveries per month)Alternate days - 5% (i.e. 15 deliveries per month)

Monthly - 50% (i.e. 1 delivery per month)

Bi-monthly - 30% (i.e. 2 deliveries per month)

Weekly - 15% (i.e. 4 deliveries per month)

Alternate days - 5% (i.e. 15 deliveries per month)

Avg. number of orders per customer per month= 0.5 * 1 + 0.3 * 2 + 0.15 * 4 + 0.05 * 15 

= 2.45

Number of food deliveries per day 

= 2.45 * 37.75 Million / 30 

= 3.083 Million

Assuming Swiggy has 60% market share, 

Number of Swiggy deliveries per hour,

= 3.083 * 0.6 / 24 

= 77,075The total number of orders delivered per hour is 77,000 orders.

(NOTE: This is the avg. number per hour. There would be sharp spikes around lunch & dinner time and significantly few orders between Midnight - 8 am)
