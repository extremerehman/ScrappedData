In this product management interview question, the interviewer is assessing your ability to provide quick estimates related to a product. The estimation could be about revenue, the number of users, or something else. Why is the interviewer asking you to do this? Because as a product manager you may need to estimate the size of a new market or revenue, or any other business opportunity, to convince stakeholders of a new idea. Therefore, this is an essential skill.

The interviewer is evaluating you on the following:

Are you methodical and articulate when explaining your estimation approach?Is the interviewer able to follow you when you make calculations?Can you make calculations quickly?Do you explain your assumptions convincingly?

Are you methodical and articulate when explaining your estimation approach?

Is the interviewer able to follow you when you make calculations?

Can you make calculations quickly?

Do you explain your assumptions convincingly?

The key to answering estimation questions is to separate the “how-to” from the calculations. Separating operations from calculations prevents the interviewer and you from getting lost in calculations and losing track of what you are calculating. An estimation tree does this. Using an estimation tree allows you to explain your logic behind the operations first, to then focus solely on calculations.

Here is how to structure the answer:

Ask clarifying questions. Clarifying eliminates any ambiguity of what should include in your calculations.Make an equation. Consider edge cases or alternate sources of data and writing any facts that you know helps with calculations.Break down the equation into components. Write your assumptions next to the components. Doing this reminds you to explain the assumptions clearly to the interviewer.Do the math. Calculate the result of each component and compute the result.Do a sanity check. Do your results make sense? If not, recheck your equation, assumptions, and arithmetic.

Make an equation. Consider edge cases or alternate sources of data and writing any facts that you know helps with calculations.

Break down the equation into components. Write your assumptions next to the components. Doing this reminds you to explain the assumptions clearly to the interviewer.

Do the math. Calculate the result of each component and compute the result.

Do a sanity check. Do your results make sense? If not, recheck your equation, assumptions, and arithmetic.

1. Ask Clarifying Questions



Q) Should we be focused on the US uploaded videos or global videos? A) You choose.Q) Are we thinking about individually uploaded videos only or should we include movies and shows you can rent? A) You choose. (I will exclude movies / TV shows.)Q) Do we need to restrict content by any means - ex. some videos only have music without any graphic content? A) You choose. (Assuming no.)Q) Is it OK to exclude Youtube TV and Youtube Music?A) Yes. Q) Is this equation for uploads within the year or uploads for the entire life of Youtube? A) You choose. 

Q) Should we be focused on the US uploaded videos or global videos? A) You choose.

Q) Do we need to restrict content by any means - ex. some videos only have music without any graphic content? A) You choose. (Assuming no.)

Q) Is it OK to exclude Youtube TV and Youtube Music?A) Yes.

2. About the Product: 

Youtube is a video platform that is owned by Google. It was bought by Google and now is a Google subsidiary. It allows users to browse content, upload videos, purchase movies and shows and do live streams. It was founded in 2005.



3. Make an Equation:



Total Videos = # of videos by individuals + # of videos by professional businesses (I am excluding movies / TV shows for rent.)



4. Breakdown of Equation: 





# of Individual Youtube Users: (Both from a viewer and uploader perspective.)Youtube operates in over 90 countries. It is blocked in others - the biggest being China. World Population: 7.8BPopulation - Non-Youtube Countries: China is the biggest population without Youtube (1.4B population).7.8B - 1.4B = 6.4B~100 countries out of 195 countries in the world do NOT have Youtube.

Younger segments are much more likely to use Youtube than older segments - guess 90% v. 60%, so we can split the difference. 1.75B * .75 = ~1.2B# of Videos / Individual User: Individual User Types: Let's split the individual uesr group into 3 groups.

Types of Businesses: Let's break down the size of businesses by the average number of employees. Majority of businesses in the US are small. Let's assume that rough percentage for the rest of the world.

Total Videos on Youtube: 

Youtube was created in 2005 - approximately 15 years ago (give or take a few months). Let's assume that the video posted each year grows by ~ 10% as video posting grows in popularity since 2015, but the platform grew at tiered rates every few years. Given that 2021 has just started, let's assume that the total we found applies to 2020.

5. Do A Sanity Check:



The number of videos on Youtube in the early years seems too high.The total videos in 2005 - 2010 = 5.4. Let's cut that in half (2.7B) given ramp up / popularity in social media is relatively recent within the last decade.149B - 2.7B = 146.3B total videos on Youtube.
