Known: Population of Delhi ~ 30 million

Assumption - 

Let the average family size be 3.



Number of Households in Delhi,

= 30 / 3 million

= 10 million



Assumption - 

The proportion of families owning 1 car =  30%

The proportion of families owning more than 1 car =  10%(As many people in delhi own more than one car)



Therefore, 

Number of cars in Delhi, 

= 40% of 10 million 

~ 4 million



Assumption - 

The proportion of Swift Cars in Delhi = 1/20 or 5%

The proportion of Swift Cars in Delhi = 1/20 or 5%



The proportion of Red color Swift cars = 1/5 or 20% of Swift cars.(considering there are 5 variants - red, yellow, blue, maroon, and orange)

The proportion of Red color Swift cars = 1/5 or 20% of Swift cars.(considering there are 5 variants - red, yellow, blue, maroon, and orange)





Number of Red Colored Swift cars in Delhi,

= Number of Cars in Delhi x Proportion of Swifts x Proportion of Red color in Swift

= 4 million x 1/20 x 1/5

~ 40,000 Red Swift cars.
