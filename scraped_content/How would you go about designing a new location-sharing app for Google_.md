The core responsibility of a product manager is to drive product vision, design and development. A business decides to make a product because it has identified a real customer need for which the customer is willing to pay. It is the role of the product manager to identify customer needs and drive the design and development of products that meet those needs.

This product design interview question tests whether you understand the process of going from customer needs to product development. This process should involve defining who the customer is and what they want to accomplish; defining multiple use case scenarios in which the customer does activities that are related to your product, and prioritizing what to build.



What is the interviewer looking for?



The interviewer is evaluating you on the following:

Do you provide keen insights about the customer and their needs?Are you able to provide multiple and diverse use case scenarios?Is your answer structured and logical, or do you go off on a tangent?Do you go beyond generalities in your solutions and provide detailed descriptions?Can you provide ideas that no other candidate has mentioned?Are you confident and sound credible? Would engineers and product people follow your lead?

Do you provide keen insights about the customer and their needs?

Are you able to provide multiple and diverse use case scenarios?

Is your answer structured and logical, or do you go off on a tangent?

Do you go beyond generalities in your solutions and provide detailed descriptions?

Can you provide ideas that no other candidate has mentioned?

Are you confident and sound credible? Would engineers and product people follow your lead?



How to structure your answer?



The steps of this method are:

C — Clarify. Ask questions to clarify what you are unsure of or confirm/disconfirm assumptions.

I — Identify the users/customers as personas like food lovers, soccer moms, etc.

R — Report on their needs (use cases). A use case is an activity that a user would like to do relative to your product.

C — Cut through and prioritize the use cases based on some attributes (revenue, customer benefit, complexity).

L — List solutions.

E — Evaluate the tradeoffs of your solutions.

S — Summarize:

State which solution you would recommend.Recap what the solution does and why it is beneficial.Explain why you prefer this solution. 

State which solution you would recommend.

Recap what the solution does and why it is beneficial.

Explain why you prefer this solution. 





Answer



1. Ask Clarifying questions



Q) Location sharing – do you mean an app that shares the location of one user with another user or groups of users?  A) YesQ) I know that android phones have a built-in function that allows a user to opt-in and share their location with other users, it is built into maps, we want to do something different than this?  A) Yes – the feature has low usage and we want to start from scratch and come up with ways that location sharing might be adopted and more useful.Q) Are there any specific goals besides adoption and usefulness?  A) I’ll leave that to you.Q) Do we have a reason for launching this feature?  A) As you mentioned location sharing is already built-in as a feature of android phones but we haven’t explored how this function could be turned into a product.Q) Is this a monetized feature?  A) Assume that this is going to be a free app and we will find monetization later.Q) Is there a specific geo or time frame for development?A) NoQ) The functionality may very well be universal but for the question are we limiting it to the US?  A) Yes

Q) Location sharing – do you mean an app that shares the location of one user with another user or groups of users?  

A) Yes

Q) I know that android phones have a built-in function that allows a user to opt-in and share their location with other users, it is built into maps, we want to do something different than this?  

A) Yes – the feature has low usage and we want to start from scratch and come up with ways that location sharing might be adopted and more useful.

Q) Are there any specific goals besides adoption and usefulness?  A) I’ll leave that to you.

Q) Do we have a reason for launching this feature?  A) As you mentioned location sharing is already built-in as a feature of android phones but we haven’t explored how this function could be turned into a product.

Q) Is this a monetized feature?  A) Assume that this is going to be a free app and we will find monetization later.

Q) Is there a specific geo or time frame for development?A) No

Q) The functionality may very well be universal but for the question are we limiting it to the US?  A) Yes



2. Goal



Create a mobile app that we believe would be adopted and used related to sharing location. 



3. Personas



Individuals that want to share their location with friends and family.Parents that want to share their location and know the location of their kids.Businesses that want to track their employees.

Individuals that want to share their location with friends and family.

Parents that want to share their location and know the location of their kids.

Businesses that want to track their employees.



4. Pick a persona based on criteria



I’d like to focus on sharing locations with friends.  Family sharing and parent-child sharing already exist and likely are mapped-based solutions (just show where they are).  Business employee tracking is the same – already exists and likely focuses on utilitarian location sharing.  I am going to try to come up with non-map-based solutions (not just showing where people are) that are more exciting.



5. Pain Points

I want to know where my friends are at.I want my friends to know where I am at.I’m bored and I want to meet up with friends.I’m meeting a group of friends and we need to find a place to meet in the middle.We are at a large location and need to find each other.

I want to know where my friends are at.

I want my friends to know where I am at.

I’m bored and I want to meet up with friends.

I’m meeting a group of friends and we need to find a place to meet in the middle.

We are at a large location and need to find each other.



6. Pick a pain point based on criteria



This is the point where I tell people not to boil the ocean and pick a pain point based on criteria.  I’m going to break my own rule – I think the solutions I am going to propose are fun and may solve multiple pain points. 



7. Solutions



Marco Polo – Marco Polo is an app that lets users announce their location to a set of friends.  It’s a Saturday night the user selects a list of friends and clicks the Marco button.  The app broadcasts to the selected friends that user says Marco – if they respond polo it shares their location and draws an arrow on the users screens that shows the direction of the friend that responds.  Why show arrows and not just directions?  I am thinking about all those times you went to the mall, a concert, a club with friends and get separated.  The map would show location but at a club we might just need to know the general direction to walk. Another use case – your friends are already seated at a large restaurant you walk in and look around – you don’t see them.  You press the Marco button, your friend presses polo – you are directionally guided to them - almost like a game of Marco Polo . Meet in the middle – You want to meet up with a group of friends for drinks, dinner, etc.  You add everyone to meet in the middle they consent, and the app determines the best place to meet in the middle.  You could imagine functionality that takes into consideration everyone’s preferences (AI).  We could add in functionality where people vote on options being presented or input what they want and the AI sorts out recommendations.  Basically it’s like an AI night planner that takes into account everyone’s location and preferences and recommends where you end up.  Imagine a tie-in with reservations and reviews. Proximity Meter - want to see who is close by – open the app it shows you how far away your opted-in friends are.  From there you could text or message friends that are close.  The app doesn’t show exact locations till you allowed it and we can limit the precession so it just shows you like who is within a mile, 5 miles, 10 miles, etc.  That way you really can’t stalk anyone – you just know they are a mile away – note you still have to opt-in even for that level or location – think uses cases like a college campus and surrounding bars.  Open the proximity meter and see which friends are close by.  "Marco"  - maybe this one and Marco Polo are a pair.

Marco polo – medium reach – medium impact – medium effortThe idea of compass directional arrows really works when people are walking distance from one another.  I think it is great for college students on campus and surrounding local bars. Meet in the middle – high reach – high impact – high effort.Proximity meter - medium reach – medium impact – medium effort.

Meet in the middle – high reach – high impact – high effort.

Proximity meter - medium reach – medium impact – medium effort.



Of the solutions, I think “meet in the middle” has the biggest impact of the solutions.  It also allows for monetization opportunities as we promote locations and make reservations.  I also think it is really helpful for users - who hasn't tried to coordinate that night out with multiple friends.  As a go-to-market strategy, I would try to tie this into existing google maps and Google assistant functionality rather than attempt to make a free-standing app.  The plus side of integration into the existing Google infrastructure is a built-in user base, the downside is that updates and v2 may be slower as we need to include them into the main code of maps and assistants rather than as a stand-alone app where we could iterate faster. 

9. Measuring Success 

Unlike maps and assistants where the user might use the functionality every day / multiple times a day – meet in the middle only gets used when groups need to meet up.  This means that measurements like  DAU and MAU and the ratio DAU / MAU will be much lower than maps and assistants – and the tool could still be a success.  I think we can design some meaningful metrics.

Acquisition - 1st-time users per period.  We should see period over period increases if the tool is gaining traction.Engagement and Utility - % of uses where the group reaches consensus and meets in the middle using the app.  The higher the consensus percentage the better the tool is operating. Retention - % of multiple uses or uses per user.  If the tool is making group meets-ups easier then we would expect to see repeat uses.Hidden (maybe) Counter Metric – the tool may be highly successful and also not get a lot of use.  It is possible that some groups will use the tool once and keep going back to that place but not use the app.  We could look at if user locations group together without using the app.

I’d also track features like reservations and POI/restaurant search when not using the app – it’s possible the poor experiences on the meet in the middle could spill over to decreased confidence in the recommendations of the maps and assistance.  

10. Limitations 



The preferences of the individuals in the group may not be known because they don’t use google maps and assistant.HUGE – if the app is built into maps and assistants then it likely does not work on IOS by default which would kill the solution (half of you have Apple phones in the US).  I really didn’t realize the fatal flow until I got here.  We would have to have an IOS campaign app or we would have to launch this as an app instead of native functionality (maybe this is why the app doesn’t already exist).The lowest common denominator  - I really love Indian food but when organizing a group of multiple friends we may never eat Indian based on AI.   The strong downward preferences of one could reduce the options and the AI might end up always guiding the group to the lowest common denominator - this happens in real life as well but you blame the person for the fact that you ended up at Tex-Mex again - here you start blaming the app.

11. Summary



I was asked to create an app that featured location sharing and would actually get used.  I looked at a few personas and settled in on friends because I felt I could create some really fun apps that weren’t just showing the other person on a map.  I looked at the pain points decided to solve the problem.  I came up with three well-named solutions and decided to go with the solution that had the biggest user impact “Meet in the Middle”.  I identified some key metrics including % of group consensus using the tool and % of returning users (do they come back).  Finally, I looked at limitations and may have killed the solution before we wrote a line of code (which is way cheaper than killing it 3 years later!).  The solution needs to work on both IOS and Android which likely means it is a free-standing app rather than built within Google maps and assistant.  This will change the adoption model of the app and needs more thought.
