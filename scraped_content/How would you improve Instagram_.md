### Step 3. Define the Goal you want to achieve. (G)



Instagram's primary goal is to provide a platform for users to visually express themselves, connect with others, and discover inspiring content. The objective of Instagram is to foster a vibrant and inclusive community where users can share their stories, passions, and creative endeavours.
