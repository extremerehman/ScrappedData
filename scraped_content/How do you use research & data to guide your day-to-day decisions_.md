What are the benefits of Data-Driven Decision-making? 

How to become more Data-Driven?

Lastly, what do I say to the interviewer?







Data-driven decision-making (sometimes abbreviated as DDDM) is the process of using data to inform your decision-making process and validate a course of action before committing to it.

In business, this is seen in many forms. For example, a company might:

Collect survey responses to identify products, services, and features their customers would like.Conduct user testing to observe how customers are inclined to use their product or services and to identify potential issues that should be resolved prior to a full release.Launch a new product or service in a test market in order to test the waters and understand how a product might perform in the market.Analyze shifts in demographic data to determine business opportunities or threats.

Example - 

Real Estate Decisions at Starbucks

After hundreds of Starbucks locations were closed in 2008, then-CEO Howard Schultz promised that the company would take a more analytical approach to identify future store locations. 

Starbucks now partners with a location-analytics company to pinpoint ideal store locations using data like demographics and traffic patterns. The organization also considers input from its regional teams before making decisions. Starbucks uses this data to determine the likelihood of success for a particular location before taking on a new investment.







You’ll Make More Confident Decisions - Once you begin collecting and analyzing data, you’re likely to find that it’s easier to reach a confident decision.Data performs multiple roles. On the one hand, it serves to benchmark what currently exists, which allows you to better understand the impact that any decision you make will have on your business. You’ll Become More Proactive - Given enough practice and the right types and quantities of data, it’s possible to leverage it in a more proactive way—for example, by identifying business opportunities before your competition does, or by detecting threats before they grow too serious.You Can Realize Cost Savings - Many businesses have started investing in Data-driven systems to increase operational efficiency and decrease expenses.

Look for Patterns Everywhere - Whether you’re in the office pouring over financial statements,  standing in line at the grocery store, or commuting on the train, look for patterns in the data around you. Once you have noticed those patterns, practice extrapolating insights and try to draw conclusions as to why they exist. Tie Every Decision Back to the Data - Whenever you’re presented with a decision, whether business-related or personal in nature, do your best to avoid relying on gut instinct when determining a course of action. Instead, make a  conscious effort to apply an analytical mindset.Visualize the Meaning Behind the Data - Data visualization is a huge part of the data analysis process. It’s nearly impossible to derive meaning from a table of numbers. By creating engaging visuals in the form of charts and graphs, you’ll be able to quickly identify trends and make conclusions about the data.Consider Furthering Your Education - If you’re uncomfortable with the idea of learning how to incorporate data into your decision-making process on your own, there are a number of educational options you can pursue to develop the data analytics and data science skills needed to succeed.

Now, coming back to,



“At my current company, we have the practice of backing almost every decision with data, be it a new product or feature launch or a minor change in the user journey. These data mostly come from market research, user research (like surveys, user interviews, user testing), or can be transactional data from the system. Taking data-driven decisions helped me make more informed decisions, validate hypotheses, understand and solve the user pain points in a better way.  

My tech background (as a Data Analyst / Data Scientist / Software Engineer) and expertise with SQL queries, has made the extraction, visualization, and understanding of data easier for me.



Let me give an example,” 

(Followed by this, you need to mention an example/story of when you made a data-backed decision and how it impacted the product metrics.)



You can refer to these steps to formulate your example/story - 

A brief about the product or feature.Describe the problem statement.List the alternatives/options you had.Details on what data you referred to and how did you get it.The key insights you found and the decision you made.The impact created on the product metrics.

A brief about the product or feature.

Describe the problem statement.

List the alternatives/options you had.

Details on what data you referred to and how did you get it.

The key insights you found and the decision you made.

The impact created on the product metrics.



A follow-up question to this might be:
