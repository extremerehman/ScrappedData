Google Product Managers are the people in charge of all Google products and features. They lead the design, engineering, and business teams to help conceptualize, build, and eventually launch products that are then used by people all over the world. 

A typical Google product manager is someone who is:

Extremely versatile

Technologically astute

Design-oriented

Strategic thinker

Data-driven

Analytical 

This is mainly because Google does not look for specialized PMs. Rather, according to an email from the company to candidates for the position, Google wants people who “can easily float through our evolving product lines.”





If you’ve been shortlisted for a product management position at Google, you should prepare yourself for a long interview process that takes place over several weeks. 

Not only does the process require multiple interviews with various people (we will cover all of this later on), you can also expect a few in-between stages where you won’t hear from anyone. 

These can last anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, and even though it can be disconcerting, it’s nothing to worry about. 

Also, if you know anyone who works at Google, you should tell your recruiter (with that person's permission of course) - the recruiter will send those Google employees a form to fill in regarding how well they know you and what they know about how you work. All this information gets added to your interview profile and can prove to be quite valuable later in the process. 

While we will be going over a lot of the questions you can expect later on in this guide, you should keep in mind that you probably will not be asked complex technical or mathematical questions. 

These are generally reserved for engineering positions at Google. 

As for the fearsome complex brain teasers that Google interviews are infamous for, the good news is that according to their hiring FAQs: “brain teaser questions didn’t predict how well someone would do on the job so we no longer ask them”.

Instead, your interview may include structured, hypothetical questions regarding issues with existing Google products and how you might handle them. 







Product manager salaries at Google generally range from $200K to $400K, while     Senior PMs can expect to make as much as $500K and upwards. 

In addition to the base salary, bonuses at Google are typically targeted at 15-20% of the base salary, while annually granted equity is generally between  45-60% - which is quite hefty, compared to industry standards.

There are two major factors that decide how much you make as a product manager at Google. 

The first one is your level. Within the product manager band, there are multiple levels. 

The level you are at is determined by both the quantity and quality of experience you bring over to Google, as well as your performance while you're there. 

This is what the different levels within the PM band and their compensations look like:





However, there is also another important factor that decides how much you make - the group you are joining. 

For instance, product managers at a certain level in the Google Cloud group may get a different salary as compared to PMs at the same level at YouTube. 





Interview Process Structure



Now that you are up to speed on all of the background information you need to know, let’s take a look at the way the interview process is structured. 





The entire Google product manager interview process is structured over a 4-8 week (on average) timeline. Over the course of this duration, you can expect to go through the following processes: 

Resume and referralsPhone screens (2 interviews)On-site interviews (4-6 interviews)Hiring committee recommendation (Behind the scenes)Senior leader review (Behind the scenes)Compensation committee recommendation (Behind the scenes)Senior executive review (Behind the scenes)Job offer!

Resume and referrals

Phone screens (2 interviews)

On-site interviews (4-6 interviews)

Hiring committee recommendation (Behind the scenes)

Senior leader review (Behind the scenes)

Compensation committee recommendation (Behind the scenes)

Senior executive review (Behind the scenes)

Job offer!





Next, let’s take a look at the different interview stages that you will go through. 

Once your resume has made it past the first round of screening, these are the following     rounds of interviews you can expect:

Phone screen with a recruiterPhone screen(s) with Product ManagersOn-site Interviews (4-6 different interviews)

Phone screen with a recruiter

Phone screen(s) with Product Managers

On-site Interviews (4-6 different interviews)

Here is a detailed look at each. 





Phone screen interviews are phone calls meant to confirm that you meet the basic requirements for a PM position, and are a candidate who has a decent chance of getting hired. This includes verifying your qualifications, skill set, experience, and role-related knowledge. 

These calls last for around 30 minutes, and are first carried out by a recruiter, and then followed up by one or two PMs. 

The recruiter will primarily be concerned about your resume and experience, and will also ask you behavioral questions. PMs on the other hand may directly ask questions regarding product design and strategy. 

However, if Google is eager to hire you, they may skip the phone screening step entirely and directly bring you in for the on-site interview. 

If this happens, it’s a really good sign!







Once the phone screens are completed, the real evaluation begins. On-site interviews traditionally take place at a Google office, where you will likely spend a full day. However, due to Covid-19, the interviews will take place remotely via Google Meet. 

The first two interviews take place in the morning, followed by lunch with a Google PM (again, this will be virtual due to Covid-19), and finally 3 interviews in the afternoon. 

Each interview will typically last 35-45 minutes, and while most of your interviewers will be product managers, you may also get an engineer who will be assessing your technical skills. 

Remember, even though they might not seem like it, the interviews will be very thorough. Each interviewer will evaluate your answers, take extensive notes and will prepare and submit a highly detailed report about your performance. 

While we cover the evaluation process in detail below, the on-site interviews are meant to gauge your strengths in four different areas - cognitive ability, leadership skills, role-related knowledge, and your “Googleyness” which means whether or not you will fit in with the culture.  

The lunch interview will be more relaxed and is generally meant as a time for you to ask questions (Google will not be evaluating you at this time), however, we highly recommend that you still consider it an evaluation. 





Interview Question Types



During all of these interviews, you will be asked many different questions that will cover a wide range of subjects. 

However, the good news is that all of these questions can be divided into 6 main groups:

Product Design - Creative and critical questions about Google products like Gmail, YouTube, etc, and even non-Google products such as Uber or Netflix. You might even be asked to design a product for another company.Product Strategy - Questions regarding Google’s vision and various markets like mobile, ads, product roadmaps, etc.Estimation - Questions meant to test your ability to work with numbers, such as market size, potential, etc.Technical Knowledge -  Questions relating to your technical knowledge and understandingData Analytics - Questions meant to test your ability to obtain, interpret, and communicate data such as metrics to track for given products or situationsBehavioral Analysis - Questions regarding your experience as a PM, motivations, and leadership style

Behavioral Analysis - Questions regarding your experience as a PM, motivations, and leadership style



The phone screen interviews will include product design, technical knowledge, and behavioral questions, while the on-site interviews will include all of the above. 





Evaluation Process



Who evaluates you?

The very first people to evaluate you will be your interviewers. These will be fellow Google PMs and may include an engineer or two if required.

However, that’s not all. 

Once your interviewers have graded your answers to their questions, they will prepare extensive feedback reports and submit them to the hiring committee. 

Hiring committees usually consist of 4-5 Googlers who are either peers or managers at different levels and again, may also include a cross-functional member (such as an engineer). 

Once the hiring committee has assessed your candidate packet - the feedback from your interviewers, your resume and references, and any samples you have provided - it will make a recommendation on whether you should be hired or not. 

If you are recommended for hire, the recommendation and your candidate pack will then be reviewed by a senior manager (or leader, as Google calls them). 

If they decide you’re a good fit, your application will be sent over to the compensation committee that will decide how much money you will be offered. 

Once decided, your candidate pack goes to executive review for final approval. 

As you might have noticed,     Google puts in a lot of effort where hiring is concerned. According to Google, the reason for so many layers of evaluation is to “help make sure we’re holding true to our hiring standards as we grow”.



This is the main reason why the entire hiring process at Google can take several weeks. 





So what exactly does Google look for in their product manager candidates? And how do they decide whether you fit in or not?

As we mentioned earlier, there are basically four different areas that you will be evaluated on: 

Cognitive ability: Your approach towards problems and how you solve them. You will be evaluated on your thought process and how you use presented data to make and prioritize your decisions. Leadership: Product managers are expected to lead and work with multiple teams across various stages of the product’s life, from launch to release. As such,         your communication and team mobilization skills are assessed. Role-related knowledge: Google not only wants to know your experience as a product manager but also your strengths and how they will both impact your future contribution to the company. Googleyness: While it may seem light, this final part is anything but. Google prides itself on its culture. As an organization that depends on its teams working and growing together, it’s very important that you fit right in.
