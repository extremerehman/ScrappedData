The population of Kolkata ~ 15 million

Population Density of Kolkata ~ 25,000 / sq km



Total area of Kolkata,

= (15,000,000 / 25,000) sq km

= 600 sq km

Assumption - 

Total land occupied by road be 30% of land

Therefore, 

Area covered by roads in Kolkata, 

= 30% of 600 sq km

= 180. sq km.

Assumption - 

Average width of road ~ 20 m

Therefore, 

Total Length of roads in Kolkata,

= (180 x 1000 x 1000) / 20  m
