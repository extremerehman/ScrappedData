Unfortunately, there is no rule book out there with instructions for how to manage, motivate and mentor staff members with more years of experience than you have.

As leaders we all want our employees to like us. But we also want to be respected. Unfortunately, many new managers are unable to strike the right balance, especially with employees who are significantly older and more experienced than they are.



Here are some tips for managing people who have more experience than you:

Acknowledge their expertise and work experience. Let them know you recognize and respect the years they've put in. Give them opportunities and leverage their capabilities to add value to the project.

Learn from the team. Itâ€™s important to point out where you lack knowledge in the field. It will help the team to avoid unnecessary blunders that could result from misplaced egotism in your leadership.

Give opportunities for the team to be visible to Senior Leadership, let them get credit for the work that they have done, and let them have a say in important decisions.

Don't be tempted to overshadow your more experienced employees to protect your own authority. Let their best skills shine, even if it means revealing the experience they have that you don't.

Learn their way rather than asking them to learn your way right away. Start by asking them how things are typically done in their field before working with them to change it up.

Lean on your experts and know when to stick with what works.

If you're not a developer, don't attempt to plan a sprint on your own. Let your employees explain reasonable expectations for their work and timelines.
