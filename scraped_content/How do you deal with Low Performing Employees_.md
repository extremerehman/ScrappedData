It's important that you have the ability to bring out the best in people and find ways to work effectively with everyone, even if there are performance issues. This includes being able to address the issue in a constructive and positive manner, without letting it escalate into a conflict or negative outcome. It's also important to find solutions that benefit the product and the team as a whole, rather than just focusing on the individual. By demonstrating these skills in an interview, you can show the interviewer that you have the ability to lead and manage a team effectively.
