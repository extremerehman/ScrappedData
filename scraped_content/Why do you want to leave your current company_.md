Looks like an easy question right? Well, it’s not always that easy.



It hurts when we get rejected in a “Product Sence” round. It hurts even more if we get rejected just because we couldn’t answer this easy question correctly.



I have seen many friends getting rejected on this question. Even I got rejected 5 times before I realized the importance of this question!

This is one of those pre-requisite questions, which you need to know before even applying for a job. This question will be asked and validated by all the HR Managers and the Hiring Managers in almost every round of the hiring process. 





There are 2 versions of the same question,

Why do you want to leave your current company/job?I see frequent switches in your resume. Can you justify them?

Your answer should be,

Short & Positive.Convincing enough & look like a valid justification.Should not bring back any more follow-up questions.

Limited Learning Opportunity - I don’t see any growth in terms of learning for the next year other than minor product enhancements. You want to work in a different industry or try out and learn something different (that you are really passionate about) to expand your skillset.Due to Covid, your current employer started laying off people across the organization.Want a Shorter commute to work. (that is provided the job role is in the same city)You got a better opportunity in terms of company, product, role. (Justification of your earlier switches).

Mentioning 2 reasons are enough to convince the Hiring Managers.

Note: Whichever reason you choose, make sure you don’t criticize or talk negatively about your current employer. That never works in your favor.
