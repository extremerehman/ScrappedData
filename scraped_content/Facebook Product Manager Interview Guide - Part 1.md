The second thing you need to know is that while the Facebook interview process is indeed tough, we are here to help you ace it! The best way to ensure you land your dream job as a Facebook PM is to prepare strategically for the interview and that is exactly what this guide is for. 

In this interview guide, we will cover everything from the interview timeline and evaluation criteria, to sample questions and how to prepare for them - everything you need to know to prepare for the most important job interview of your life! 









What does a Facebook Product Manager do?



Facebook PMs are the people in charge of designing, building, and eventually launching products for the company. They work alongside and lead teams of world-class software engineers, product designers, marketing experts, and data scientists. 

PMs are expected to take charge and set the vision for their product, lead the ideation and technical development, define metrics and goals, and so on - all the way to executing and launching the product. 

A typical Facebook PM is someone:

Innovative and visionary.Thinks at scale (billions of Facebook users).Likes solving problems.Data-driven.Loves and uses Facebook products.Committed to Facebook's vision of connecting people.

Innovative and visionary.

Thinks at scale (billions of Facebook users).

Likes solving problems.

Data-driven.

Loves and uses Facebook products.

Committed to Facebook's vision of connecting people.

You should also keep in mind that much like Google, Facebook doesn't really look for specialist PMs. Instead, there is a high chance that you will join the company 'unallocated', which means you will not be assigned a specific role or a team at the start. Once you join, your first 4-6 weeks will be your Bootcamp - a training program that will not only get you to a fast start but will also be an opportunity to find the role and team that you are a perfect fit for. 





What is the Facebook interview process like?



The Facebook PM interview process takes anywhere between 4-8 weeks and involves multiple interviews with different people. We will go through all of these - including the specific interview timeline, question types, and evaluation criteria - later on. 

What you should keep in mind is that, unlike other companies, Facebook is quite straightforward about its interview process, unlike other companies that treat their interviews like exams. 

What does this tell you? 

Well, the reason Facebook is so open is because they want their candidates to come prepared. They do not want to surprise or trick you, so do not expect any questions of that sort. 

In fact, PM interviews at Facebook, while challenging, are very straightforward and more like in-depth conversations between the interviewer and interviewee - as compared to a question and answer session. This helps Facebook decide whether or not you are a good fit for the company. 



Facebook Product Manager Salary:



PM salaries at Facebook generally range between $225 - $499K per year, which is quite hefty for industry standards.  

In addition to the base salary, you can expect to get annual bonuses that are targeted at 15-25% percent of the base, and annual stock options can be anywhere between 40-80%, which is again quite lucrative. 

How much you make as a PM at Facebook mainly depends on what level you are at. There are 3 different product manager levels, each with their own compensation scale. Your level is determined primarily by your skill and experience, but also by your performance at the company. 

This is what Facebook PM level bands and their compensations look like: 







However, there are a couple of other factors that also decide how much money you make - the specific team you join and more importantly, your location.



Interview Process Structure



Since we are now up to speed on all of the important background information, let's take a look at how the Facebook PM interview process is structured. 





The entire interview process is structured over a course of 4-8 weeks on average. During this time period, you can expect to go through the following steps: 

Resume and referrals.HR phone screen (1 interview).PM phone screens (2 interviews).On-site interviews (3 interviews).Hiring committee review (Behind the scenes)

Resume and referrals.

HR phone screen (1 interview).

PM phone screens (2 interviews).

On-site interviews (3 interviews).

Hiring committee review (Behind the scenes)



Interviews



Let's take a quick look at all the different interviews you will go through. 





In most cases, your interview process will begin with a phone call from an HR recruiter. This 30-minute phone call is meant to confirm that you fulfill all the basic requirements for the position and if you have any chance of getting hired at all. 

The HR recruiter will ask you questions related to your resume, qualifications, and work experience, and you should always expect the all-important 'Why Facebook?' question at this stage. 

Once you've cleared this first stage, the HR recruiter will schedule two phone screen interviews with different PMs. These will take place via video call and both of these phone screens, as well as all on-site interviews, will be of 45 minutes each. 

The PMs will ask you questions about yourself for the first 5-8 minutes and then will quickly move on to the interview questions. The final 3-5 minutes will be your chance to ask any questions you have. 





After you are through with the phone screens, you will have 3 different on-site interviews. While these typically happen on the same day at any Facebook office location, due to Covid19 these will most likely also take place via video call. 

Again, each interview will take 45 minutes, and will follow the same structure as the phone screens earlier - 5-8 minutes of questions about yourself, interview questions, and finally your chance to ask a few questions.  





Before we go over the evaluation process in detail below, let's take a look at the kind of questions you can expect to be asked. 

Throughout the interview process, Facebook will assess you in 3 fundamental interview areas, and all interview questions will follow these themes:

Product Sense: your product design and strategy skills Execution: how capable you are at getting things doneLeadership and Drive: whether or not you are an empathetic and visionary leader

Product Sense: your product design and strategy skills 

Execution: how capable you are at getting things done

Leadership and Drive: whether or not you are an empathetic and visionary leader

At the phone screen stage, you will typically get a Product Sense and Execution interview with each PM, while the on-site interviews will each focus on one of the 3 themes. 





Evaluation Process 





The first people to evaluate you are your interviewers. After your phone screen interviews, the PMs you have talked to will have 24 hours to prepare and submit their reports into the internal system. The HR recruiter will then access and review these, and based on the feedback decide whether or not you can proceed for the on-site interviews. The on-site interviews are where it gets serious and the main decision-making takes place. 

What makes Facebook so unique, is that the interviews are not conducted by the hiring manager, or any PM from the team that has an opening. Instead, Facebook believes that interviewing is a skill, and the interviews are only conducted by 'calibrated' interviewers who have been extensively trained for each core category. This is a process that can take several months, but at the end of the day it ensures that the interviewers are good at making fair and consistent decisions.

Once you are done with all three on-site interviews, each of the three 'calibrated' interviewers will make a Hire or Not Hire decision-based on how well you have performed and will submit their recommendations. Next, the recruiter will compile your candidate 'packet' (interview feedback, reports, resume, referrals, etc), which they will then use to present your case to the hiring committee which includes senior leaders across Facebook. The hiring committee will review your packet and make a final decision, as well as decide your level and compensation. 







We already know the three main areas where Facebook expects their PM candidates to excel: Product Sense, Execution, and Leadership. 

Before we discuss these in detail below, here are a few areas beyond the basic categories where you can set yourself apart from the competition:

Facebook looks for PMs that are visionaries and can think big. Facebook products impact billions of users' lives every single day. As a company, they simply can't afford to focus on products that serve a niche market. As a potential Facebook PM, you should always be asking yourself: 'Am I solving a big enough problem?'Facebook wants people who can break down big problems into little pieces to solve them. You should focus on knowing the specific problems you want to solve, and how you can break a big idea into small, easy-to-solve problems. Facebook really cares about moving fast. Their motto used to be 'move fast and break things' before being changed to the more tamer 'move fast with stable infrastructure'. That being said, notice that speed still matters a lot and also speaks to their execution questions.Facebook wants people who love Facebook products and use them. This is especially true for PM candidates, as Facebook wants you to already be thinking about how you can make their products better. Most of the questions you will be asked will be related in some way or the other to existing Facebook products. You should ideally be familiar with key features and recent updates with all major products.
