### Why are Product Metrics Questions asked?



Product Metric Interview Questions are frequently asked by interviewers during Product Management interviews to gauge your aptitude on whether you are able to properly, identify the key metrics that would help analyze a feature’s performance and its impact on the business, the users, and the product.

Common Mistakes to avoid:

1. Not describing the product, the feature, its goals and directly jumping into defining the metrics.
2. Not giving a structured answer and defining generic metrics. (e.g. I would check if the users are using the feature or not).

### Describe the Product



Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social media platform available on both native app and desktop web, that helps people quickly edit and share photos/videos publicly or to a pre-approved audience. They can also share images, videos, and other people's posts privately via direct messages. People can also share disappearing stories via the Stories feature, watch & share long-form videos on IGTV, and short-form content via Reels.

For today’s discussion, we will be focusing only on Instagram Ads.
