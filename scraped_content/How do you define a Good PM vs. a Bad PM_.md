In order to define a Good v. Bad Product Manager, I'd first like to define what a Product Manager does. 

Product Manager Overview: A PM guides every step of the product's lifecycle from development. They advocate for customers and maintain a pulse on the external marketplace to build the best solution. PM work is an intersection of Business, UX, and Technology. 

Business: PM wants to help the team achieve business objectives by building the gap between Development, Design, the customer, and Business. UX: PM focuses on user experience and represents the voice of the customer. Technology: PM maintains a close relationship with Technology and has a sufficient grasp of technical builds/functionality.

UX: PM focuses on user experience and represents the voice of the customer. 

Technology: PM maintains a close relationship with Technology and has a sufficient grasp of technical builds/functionality. 

In order to do their job, the PM must focus on three main areas/themes: 1) Product Strategy / Vision, 2) Product Build and 3) Partner Management. 

Within each of these themes, I will discuss what traits of a Good v. bad PM.
