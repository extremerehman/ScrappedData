Here is a list of common mistakes which people make while answering product pricing questions:



Your pricing strategy is driven by the product and how relevant it is to your target audience given the market dynamics. The more information you provide here, the easier it is for you to choose an objective and build an argument for a pricing strategy later. This is particularly important when you are in a highly competitive and commoditized market  (e.g., cloud storage). 

Not having any objective will result in a pricing strategy that might not be aligned with the current realities of the company. Many interview candidates go straight into suggesting a strategy or two without considering the fact that the objective (e.g., driving revenue or grabbing market share) should drive the pricing strategy and not the other way around.

Companies, especially in the tech space, are always innovating their pricing strategies. There are usually various strategies one can consider depending on the company and product objective. SAAS, for example,  is only one type of pricing strategy. Make sure to think beyond the obvious strategies to help you achieve your objective.



If you are considering a SAAS model, make sure to consider the impact of pricing for different client sizes and usages given the companyâ€™s target market. While a number of companies can generate revenue with a  simple SAAS payment model, it is important to have one that helps you achieve your objective while keeping in mind that your product has various user groups with different usage habits.
