## Why are Product Design Questions asked?

Product Design Interview Questions are asked in order to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically and creatively when designing new products. These questions are used to assess a candidate's ability to:

1. Develop a structured thought process when faced with ambiguous or uncertain conditions. This includes the ability to understand and analyze customer needs, identify pain points, and develop solutions that align with the goals of the product.
2. Identify and evaluate pain points in the customer journey. This includes understanding the customer's needs, wants, and frustrations, and developing solutions that address these pain points.
3. Utilize creativity and imagination to design new products that are practical, usable, and innovative. This includes the ability to think outside the box, come up with unique solutions, and iterate on designs based on feedback.
4. Estimate the implementation efforts and costs associated with the design. This includes understanding the resources and skills required to bring the product to market, and the costs associated with development, testing, and deployment.

## Step 3: Define the Goals

The primary goal of introducing a Podcast feature for Instagram is to allow users to publish and listen to original audio recordings on various topics directly within the app. This aligns with Instagram’s mission of fostering self-expression and inspiration by offering a new, engaging content format.

By integrating podcasts, we aim to:

* Enhance user engagement and increase time spent on the platform by introducing a long-form audio content format that complements Instagram’s existing features.
* Provide users with additional opportunities for self-expression through podcast creation, enabling creators to share stories, insights, and expertise in an audio-centric format.
* Track and optimize engagement metrics such as daily and monthly active users (DAU, MAU) for the podcast functionality to ensure widespread adoption and usage.
* Create potential monetization opportunities through ad placements, sponsorships, and subscription models tied to podcast content.
