## Why are Product Design Questions asked?

Product Design Interview Questions are asked in order to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically and creatively when designing new products. These questions are used to assess a candidate's ability to:

1. Develop a structured thought process when faced with ambiguous or uncertain conditions. This includes the ability to understand and analyze customer needs, identify pain points, and develop solutions that align with the goals of the product.
2. Identify and evaluate pain points in the customer journey. This includes understanding the customer's needs, wants, and frustrations, and developing solutions that address these pain points.
3. Utilize creativity and imagination to design new products that are practical, usable, and innovative. This includes the ability to think outside the box, come up with unique solutions, and iterate on designs based on feedback.
4. Estimate the implementation efforts and costs associated with the design. This includes understanding the resources and skills required to bring the product to market, and the costs associated with development, testing, and deployment.

## Step 1: Ask Clarifying Questions

You: “Before we move on, I have a few clarifying questions I want to ask. Shall I proceed?”

Q1) What types of sports venues are we aiming to support (e.g., football fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, gyms)?

A) Upto you to decide.

Q2) How should pricing be structured? Should it vary based on the type of venue, time of day, or season?

A) Upto you to decide.

## Step 2: Define the Goals

The primary goal of designing a Sports Venue Booking App is to enhance the accessibility and monetization opportunities for sports facilities. By creating a seamless booking platform, the app aims to:

* Improve user satisfaction and retention by offering a convenient, centralized platform for discovering and booking sports venues.
* Optimize venue utilization and revenue generation by connecting users with underutilized spaces and helping venue owners manage bookings effectively.
* Gather valuable insights on user preferences and booking patterns to inform targeted marketing and potential sponsorship opportunities.
* Create additional revenue streams through transaction fees, premium listings, and potential partnerships with sports equipment vendors or local service providers.

Focus Segment: Supply Side - Independent Venue Owners

Focusing on independent venue owners as the primary supply segment can create a strong inventory of diverse venues, essential for attracting demand-side users. Independent venues are typically underserved, with limited visibility and booking capabilities, offering the app a unique value proposition as the go-to platform for small and independent venue listings.

* Why Prioritize Supply Side?Building a comprehensive inventory of venues is critical for user adoption on the demand side. Independent owners are underserved, and helping them fill unutilized slots can foster loyalty.With a robust and diverse supply, demand-side engagement is likely to follow, as users find value in the app’s range of offerings.

## Step 5: Pain Points

Here are some of the pain points of the Independent Venue Owners category:

1. Many independent sports venue owners struggle to attract customers, missing out on potential bookings due to limited marketing resources and lack of digital presence. Without visibility, it’s challenging to compete with larger venues that have established marketing channels.
2. Determining the right price is challenging for venue owners who need to balance affordability for users with profitability. Many lack data-driven insights, leading to inconsistent earnings and difficulty establishing competitive yet sustainable pricing models.
3. Managing bookings, cancellations, and no-shows manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. Venue owners often find it difficult to keep track of availability, avoid overbooking, and ensure smooth booking management, especially during peak times or for multiple bookings.
4. Handling payments manually can lead to delayed cash flow and errors. Owners need secure, automated payment systems that handle transactions efficiently, helping them avoid payment disputes, minimize processing errors, and reduce administrative overhead.
5. Independent owners are often concerned about maintaining the quality and security of their venues, especially regarding unauthorized access, facility damage, and enforcing accountability for misuse. These concerns affect the owner’s ability to offer a safe and well-maintained environment.
6. Responding to inquiries about availability, amenities, and pricing without a centralized communication tool can be overwhelming, impacting response times and overall customer satisfaction. Owners often find it challenging to keep up with messages, which can lead to missed bookings or frustrated customers.
7. Preparing the venue for each booking (e.g., setting up equipment, arranging seating, or ensuring cleanliness) requires significant time and effort. Without an efficient way to handle back-to-back bookings, owners risk delays and dissatisfied customers.
8. Venue owners may want to offer extras such as equipment rentals, coaching services, or refreshments but lack a system to integrate these add-ons seamlessly with bookings. This limits revenue potential and the ability to enhance the customer experience through bundled offerings.
9. Independent venue owners typically lack access to insights on customer preferences, peak times, and usage patterns. This information gap makes it difficult to optimize pricing, plan for demand, or tailor services to meet customer expectations, impacting long-term growth.
