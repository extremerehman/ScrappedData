Once you are done asking clarifying questions and defining the business goals for the product, the next step would be to define the different user segments for the product or feature.



How do you segment users?



The key to properly segment users is to divide them so that they are distinct from one another and possess distinct meaningful attributes.

Keep in mind the purpose of user segmentation here is to come up with specific problems faced by those users which have not been solved yet.

It may also happen that in some interviews the interviewer predefines the user segment to focus on, in the problem statement itself. In such cases you can skip this step.

Product Usage Frequency, Purpose of using the product, Profession/Lifestyle of users using the product.Type of product used/consumed.Geographical location.
