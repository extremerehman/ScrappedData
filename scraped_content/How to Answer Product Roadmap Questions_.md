Developing a product roadmap is one of the most important responsibilities of a  product manager, which is why product roadmap questions are one of the most frequently asked during interviews. Product roadmap interview  questions evaluate your ability to:

Identify the long-term opportunities of a technology and productDevelop a concrete plan to achieve your product visionCut through various strategic choices to focus on what matters

Identify the long-term opportunities of a technology and product

Develop a concrete plan to achieve your product vision

Cut through various strategic choices to focus on what matters

Product roadmap questions are similar to product design and product improvement questions in the sense that you should know the user group,  pain points, and the criteria of success that you are focusing on.

These questions are usually asked without referring to a specific product. The interviewer may ask you: “How do you develop a product  roadmap?” Alternatively, the interviewer might ask you a roadmap question together with a product design question, e.g., Part 1: Design an amusement park. Part 2: How would you build a roadmap for it?

The framework below suits a technology product that has some level of maturity when it comes to existing users and product-market fit. A  product manager for a brand new technology product that does not have a  product-market fit should generally prioritize building MVP capabilities as fast as possible to test out assumptions and find a fit. 

Things also change more rapidly in a younger product, which requires the product manager to be more versatile and change plans based on new information coming in. For any technology product, a roadmap may need to be adjusted with new information that may arise. This happens more often with an early-stage technology where new information is coming to light more rapidly, and less often for a mature product that has existing users and a product-market fit.





How to answer Product Roadmap Questions?



Here is a step by step guide/framework, you should follow while answering product roadmap interview questions: 







Your goal here is to ensure that you have a clear understanding of where the company and product are today. In order to build a roadmap,  you would want to know the answers to the following questions:

Does the product have a large volume of users?Is the company looking to expand the product user base?Are they still looking for a product-market fit?Do they have financial resources to grow?What does the company leadership think are its priorities?Where are they in terms of product maturity?Are there any particular market trends or recent developments that you have to pay special attention to?

Does the product have a large volume of users?

Is the company looking to expand the product user base?

Are they still looking for a product-market fit?

Do they have financial resources to grow?

What does the company leadership think are its priorities?

Where are they in terms of product maturity?

Are there any particular market trends or recent developments that you have to pay special attention to?





The product vision helps you come up with a destination while your product roadmap helps you move toward that destination. It is very important to have a product vision that speaks to the realities of the business, the product, its users, and market, etc. The information you have gathered or described in step 1 helps you come up with a product vision.

It is important to highlight that as the product manager in charge of the product, you should be communicating the product vision to your stakeholders and ensure that their feedback and perspectives are taken into consideration. In the real world, this step may take some time as you will most likely be exploring multiple visions. If the vision is being communicated to you by your manager, you will also need some time to really understand it well.

In many cases, the product vision is clear and already set by previous product managers or the leadership team. Your responsibility here would be to understand it and execute it. For your interview, if you are asked to develop the roadmap for a particular product, you will have to come up with your product vision during the session.





Once you have developed your product vision, you set a short-term goal to get you closer to bringing your product vision to reality. The goal here should be driven by the current state of the company and the product vision that you have developed (unless the interviewer gives you a specific objective). It might help to think of the goal as a  near-term objective that gets you closer to the longer objective, the product vision.

Note that your product roadmap will be driven by the goal that you will be selecting. It is important then to pay close attention to selecting a goal that is meaningful, achievable, and yet ambitious.  There are various goals that you can select. Here are a few examples:

Driving market shareCapturing a new market before competitorsSetting up a new distribution channelIncreasing revenue per customerGrowing your user base

Driving market share

Capturing a new market before competitors

Setting up a new distribution channel

Increasing revenue per customer

Growing your user base





The metrics that you will be suggesting here will depend on the goal you have selected, your resources, and the current state of the company.

For example, if your goal is to grow the user base as fast as possible, a good metric to focus on is the number of monthly active users since it is indicative of your success in achieving your goal. You can also suggest secondary metrics to help you further measure how your product is performing as a whole. In this example, a possible secondary metric could be the number of sign-ups.





This step might not apply if the product has not found a  product-market fit yet, in which case, the priority should be to build features that will help you quickly test ideas and find a product-market fit.

If there is an established product-market fit and the product is becoming more mature, it makes sense to identify the user group that you would like to cater to. You might also want to meet the needs of various user groups in multiple phases as your product goes through growth. Either way, it is important to know who your product is going to serve over the next few months or years as you build your product roadmap.





Your objective at this step is to identify the pain points associated with your target user groups and determine the features you’d like to build to solve those pain points.

You can describe this step as an iterative process that will take some time, as you would have to interview users; review analytics data and the market; and collaborate with engineering, business, and product design to brainstorm on features and solutions and estimate the resources required. The iterative approach also helps you ensure that you can explore various alternatives if you think a particular solution has a big implementation cost and longer process.

The outcome of your work here is ideally a diagram that includes two axes: The x-axis that includes the impact on the user (the value you are creating for your target user group) and the y-axis that includes the implementation cost. The information on this chart will help you determine what should be built and when they should be built. 

Note that you can use more criteria than just the two suggested above. The additional criteria can be business impact, other teams’  needs, revenue, cost-saving opportunity, etc. To keep things simple,  though, you can assume that the importance of those other metrics was already captured when you thought about the company’s current state, the product vision, and your goal.





Now that you have a good idea about the things you would like to build, the resources needed to build them, and the value they offer, put them into a timeline to help you achieve your goal. This step will require collaboration with stakeholders such as engineering, product design, and other teams, as prioritizing some projects over others might have additional benefits.
