A micro-tragedy is a moment in a driver's day that can spoil their relationship with the ride-sharing company they are working for. Something the driver sees as unfair but can happen, e.g., an extra-long wait time between trips, a rider who makes the driver wait an excessively long time or a perceived false promise made by the ride-sharing app to the driver.



We believe that micro-tragedies have an outsized impact on driver happiness.



Help ride-sharing app better understand the micro-tragedy space. What are the different ways micro-tragedies could occur? How might these micro-tragedies impact the business? Based on that understanding, define a north star and roadmap to achieve that north star. In your roadmap, help clarify what problems/products we'd approach first and why. Choose one of your initial products and create a rough sketch of what it might look like and what the high-level requirements might be.

As per the survey data, micro-tragedies resulting in misaligned driver earnings are the largest factor driving high churn rates and low satisfaction rates among drivers. This also negatively impacts the demand-supply curve and brand value.This deck explores the arena of the misaligned earnings issue in detail and recommends a technical and creative proposal for a feature enhancement in the driver side of the app.The proposal tackles the problem by creating a new driver interface via which new drivers can provide their availability and flexible driving schedules. The smart optimizer algorithm will then use this personalized schedule, region, and historical data to provide an estimated earnings due at the end of the driver schedule. The estimated earnings goal-setter can also be triggered for drivers who are struggling after the new driver pilot program.

A micro-tragedy is an event that a driver perceives as unfair and ends up blaming the ride-sharing firm.
