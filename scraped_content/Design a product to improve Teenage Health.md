Before jumping on to the solution,

Why are Product Design Questions asked?

Interviewers like to ask Product Design Interview Questions as a way to evaluate your ability to:

Formulate a structured thinking process in an ambiguous environment.Find and evaluate pain points in the customer journey.Use your creativity and imagination to come up with solutions to build new products that are practical and usable today.Estimate implementation efforts and cost.

Formulate a structured thinking process in an ambiguous environment.

Find and evaluate pain points in the customer journey.

Use your creativity and imagination to come up with solutions to build new products that are practical and usable today.

Estimate implementation efforts and cost.



How to answer Product Design Questions?



Here is a step by step guide/framework, you should follow while answering product design interview questions:

1. Ask clarifying Questions to narrow the scope. (Q)

2. Define the Goal you want to achieve. (G)3. List the User Segments and choose one segment to focus on. (U)

4. List and prioritize the Pain Points. (P)

5. List out your Solutions. (S)

6. Evaluate the solutions and prioritize them. (E)

7. Walk through the MVP & Define the Success Metrics (M)

8. Summarize your answer (S)

(PQ-GUP-SEMS) -> Mnemonic to help you remember the steps & their order.



Clarify the Scope of the Question



Before you start designing the product, it is important to clarify and narrow down the scope of the question and get confirmation from the interviewer that they agree with your scope.

Here are a few things you'd like to get clarity on:

The target segment: Is it parents or doctors or teenagers or are we targeting schools as well?A) Assume that it can be accessible by all.What is the goal of the product?A) Assume it’s the general physical and mental health problems faced by teenagers/ potential problems that they could be faced with.What kind of product are we planning and why are building it? Is it a general educational product or a product which offers certain services too?A) Assume that it’s a mix of both.Are we focusing on any particular platform like a desktop web or mobile app or a physical product?A) Let’s focus on Mobile App.

What is the goal of the product?A) Assume it’s the general physical and mental health problems faced by teenagers/ potential problems that they could be faced with.

What kind of product are we planning and why are building it? Is it a general educational product or a product which offers certain services too?A) Assume that it’s a mix of both.

Are we focusing on any particular platform like a desktop web or mobile app or a physical product?A) Let’s focus on Mobile App.



Next, let’s define “Who I am” I am a - 

Big corporations like Google, FB, etc. who have access to their inherent products like maps, Fitbit, android apps, etc., or an upcoming start-up with limited resources and capabilities. A) Assume you are a big corporation with unlimited resources and capabilities at your disposal.

Q) Do we have any competitor products that I need to be aware of, or is our product going to be first in the market?Q) Do I have any time constraints to launch this?Q) Do I have any constraints on pricing or markets I have to build this for? A) Yours is the first to the market product so you can define the market, pricing and there is no constraint related to the launching of the product.

Now let’s understand health problems in the context of Teenagers.

Health problems can be classified under 2  big umbrellas for teens,

Physical ObesityDrug abuseAlcoholEating disorder Teen pregnancies  STDMental Depression.Anxiety.ADHD.Smartphone/social media.Body image issue.Bullying.

Q) Which particular health problems should we focus on?

A) let’s pick Mental health.

Answer Structure,

Why are we building this  -  Clarify & narrow down the problem.Who all are we building this for - Identify user segments, user pain points.How will we build this - Product mission/vision, feature set, roadmap, rollout plan, GTM, and Tradeoff.

Who all are we building this for - Identify user segments, user pain points.

How will we build this - Product mission/vision, feature set, roadmap, rollout plan, GTM, and Tradeoff.



Why are we building this?



A few common factors on which health & health care of an individual depends are:

Gender types (due to additional hormonal changes that are very gender-specific).Location(First world vs the Third world)Economic status (Poor, Middle class, Rich).Government Assistance.Access to technologyEducation structure, and support. 

Gender types (due to additional hormonal changes that are very gender-specific).

Location(First world vs the Third world)

Economic status (Poor, Middle class, Rich).

Government Assistance.

Access to technology

Education structure, and support. 



Following are some of the assumptions I am making while proceeding,

We are solving the teenage problem for all irrespective of Gender type.We are currently going to solve for First world countries(Poor, Middle Class or Rich) to begin with because,Mental health as an health issue is being recognized and accepted well in first-world countries. In Underdeveloped countries, there are auxiliary problems of access to food, access to education, and access to healthcare which might make it harder to narrow down the issue.The solution we come up with might be easier to reach teens in First world countries with easier access to technology (Smartphones and consistent internet connections - at school and home) A clear distinction between mental health caused by external factors (social media, peer pressure) vs internal factors (obesity, other physical health affecting mental issues ex: being sick longer has a mental impact). For this problem, I would like to focus on Mental health brought in by external factors.

Summarizing the Problem statement

The problem statement can be defined as,

Build a Product to improve the Mental health (caused by external triggers) of all teenagers in First world countries, irrespective of their socio-economic status.  

We are focusing on mental health issues as it is one of the major teenage causes of suicides, school dropouts, lagging back at school, depression, homelessness, juvenile cases. 

List of User Segments

Now I would like to focus Who are we building this for,

Any products we build for teens should cover a well-rounded feedback mechanism that is very important in resolving Mental health issues. 

Teens (age:10 to 19)Parents/CaregiversTeachers - optionallyCounselor/Therapist/Doctors 

Teens (age:10 to 19)

Parents/Caregivers

Teachers - optionally

Counselor/Therapist/Doctors 

Prioritized User segment:

For the scope of this question, we are going ahead with the Teenager’s segment.

List and prioritize the Pain Points

Next, I would list down the pain points that teenagers have from mental health standpoint imposed by external factors,

Not able to distinguish real issues vs superficial issues so they can move on.Information overload (Facts, Fake, controversial data).Not enough support role models to talk to or emulate.Unable to handle emotions. Peer pressure.Pressure from family to get good grades.Unrealistic standards are set by social media.

List of Solutions

App will have the capability to sync with the user calendar (School timing schedule) or have the user create calendar events. The app will plan the user's day effectively with appropriate breaks.App clearly highlights or provides the breakdown of time spent on social media, actual physical activities (basketball class, PE class).App has a clear daily journal or daily checkpoint call to action ( okay, feeling annoyed, feeling overwhelmed, feeling sad, etc) The app, based on the teen's mood and interests will suggest content/videos/messages to make it better. Like, on figuring out the teen is sad, the app recommends their favorite comedy shows/ series/ videos to watch.Depending on the teen’s location, current news relevant to the city, state, country, and the news trends on social media (Tiktok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat) App will send out quick cards about actual facts, % of the likelihood of that news, Subject matter experts opinion on the current events. App can also be configured to provide a scorecard (mental score) of the day (Red, Yellow, Green) that can be shared with caregivers and therapists to monitor consistent Red patterns and to intervene.  – This will be part of the Feedback portion of the app.Moonshot idea: Extend the App with VR capabilities so users can jump in and express themselves freely with a virtual(game mode-AI model) therapist to share their issues, and the model provides them a gaming course to tackle that will enhance the brain neurons to come out of the depressed mode. Gamification services: Since teenagers are fond of games, certain educational games can be built in the application which will also help the children express their issues freely as well as gain the necessary knowledge.Discussion Forums: To discuss ideas and problems anonymously which can be answered by the users as well as experts.

The paid services that will be available are :

Yoga/ activity/ meditation services: This program will be on the application and divided into two sections. One will be an unpaid service for 15 days which can be converted into a paid service post the 15 days trial. The program will also be divided between generic as well as specific problems. An instructor will be provided and this will be a video program. The specific problems can be PCOD/ weight gains/ hypo or hyper suitism etc.Doctors consultation: This will be an online consultation either on a video call or phone call to mental health experts/ certain specialist doctors etc. Since the teenagers are not very comfortable sharing their issues with even their parents at times and do not have the proper guidance from an expert. This app will also let the users know the reviews of each of the doctors and their areas of specialization before they decide to subscribe.

Now I would like to weigh each one of these features against Impact to User, Impact to Company(Will company be able to sustain to stay relevant), Engineering complexity (Time to build and available capabilities).

With the above breakdown, I will focus on 4, 3, 9, 1, and 2 for the initial launch, 8, 10, 11, 6 & 5 in the future roadmap, 7 into a couple of years.

As we are dealing with user data we need to be clear of User data privacy, and security. We need to comply with each region's laws to make sure we don’t violate the law.  Things like GDPR, Right to be forgotten have to be incorporated.

Success Metrics:

As it’s first to launch I am considering Adoption /User acquisitions and Activation as the North Stars metrics,

# of App downloads.# of User signups.Daily Active Users and Monthly Active Users values. (To keep an eye on stickiness.)Quick Ratio = (Active user + Resurrected users - Retained users)/User Churn > 1
