Here is a list of common mistake which people make while answering product metrics questions:



If you jump into listing a metric without picking an objective,  thinking through the journey of the user, listing out the relevant metrics for each phase of the journey, and prioritizing them based on the criteria and objective you’ve highlighted, it’s very likely that you’ll miss a more important metric.

A better approach is to take a step-by-step approach and first think about the objectives, then the journey then lists a bunch of metrics,  and finally determine the primary and secondary metrics based on your evaluation.



For example, “Number of users who use the product” is too vague as a  metric because it doesn’t clearly define ‘usage’, ‘user’, and a  particular time frame you are looking at. Be specific with your metric so that it’s measurable. A more specific metric than “Number of users who use the product” can be “Number of users who interacted with the product for at least 5 minutes in the last 30 days”.

Don’t be shy about listing many metrics. It shows your ability to think analytically. You can pick multiple metrics and then pick the ones that you find to be the most relevant metrics based on your evaluation of the metrics.



There are unlimited number of metrics that can be looked at. One way to help yourself stay focused during the listing metrics that are more relevant to the question is by keeping your objective in mind. Without an objective in mind, you can end up listing many metrics that can not help you measure the success of your product in achieving the objective that you’ve articulated earlier.
