Why are Product Metrics Questions asked?



Product Metric Interview Questions are frequently asked by interviewers during Product Management interviews to gauge your aptitude on whether you are able to properly, identify the key metrics that would help analyze a feature’s performance and its impact on the business, the users, and the product.

Common Mistakes to avoid:

Not describing the product, the feature, its goals and directly jumping into defining the metrics.Not giving a structured answer and defining generic metrics. (e.g. I would check if the users are using the feature or not).

How to Answer a Product Metrics Question?



The key to correctly answering a Product Metric Question is following a structured framework.

Here is a step by step framework, you can follow while answering Product Metrics questions in Product Management Interviews : 

Describe the Product. (P)Describe the Feature. (F)Define the feature Goals you want to achieve (G)Describe the User Journey of the feature (J)Define the Metrics for each step of the User Journey (M)Evaluate and Prioritize the Metrics. (E)Summarize your answer (S)

Describe the Product. (P)

Describe the Feature. (F)

Define the feature Goals you want to achieve (G)

Describe the User Journey of the feature (J)

Define the Metrics for each step of the User Journey (M)

Evaluate and Prioritize the Metrics. (E)

Summarize your answer (S)

(PF-VGJ-MES) -> Mnemonic to help you remember the steps & their order.

Now, let’s go through each of the above points and understand them in details,





1. Describe the Product

To get things moving in the right direction, it is important to make sure that you and the interviewer are on the same page when it comes to the understanding of the product, its features, offerings, users and competitors.

Cover the following things about the product,

What does the product do?Who is it for?How are they using it?What pain point is it solving for its users?

What does the product do?

Who is it for?

How are they using it?

What pain point is it solving for its users?

If you get a question where you are not familiar with the product, you may ask the interviewer to give a brief idea about the product. They would usually help out.

Before continuing, make sure the interviewer concurs with your understanding of the product. 



Example: (Product - Facebook)

Let’s take this one - How would you evaluate the success of Reactions on Facebook?

“Facebook is a social media platform that mainly focuses on letting users share parts of their life using images, texts, videos, stay connected with friends and family, and to discover, share and express what’s matter to them. It also has multiple other elements like the  messenger, marketplace, groups, games jobs but for today's discussion, we will focus only on the basic Facebook Reactions.”



2. Describe the Feature

Once you are done describing the Product, its time to give a brief description about the feature. Cover the following things about the feature,

What does the feature do?Who is it for?How are they using the feature?What pain point is that feature solving for its users?

What does the feature do?

Who is it for?

How are they using the feature?

What pain point is that feature solving for its users?



Example: (Feature: Facebook Reactions)

“Facebook Reactions are an improvement over the Likes feature where users can express their exact emotions such as love, sadness, anger, and amusement for a post.

They allow users a faster and efficient way to express complex emotions without spending the time to write the comment.”



Its important that the interviewer concurs with the same definition and understanding of the feature before moving on to the next step.

3. Define the Goal you want to achieve



While answering a Product Metric question, we will be evaluating the success of a feature. Hence, its important to have a clarity on the goals we are trying to achieve. 

Sometimes the goal will be given as a part of the question by the interviewer(e.g. question - How do you measure the success of comments in driving engagement on Instagram?)In such scenario, we can skip the goal definition part.



If the goal is not mentioned in the interview question, we will have to define the goal in this step. (e.g question - How will you evaluate the success of Instagram Stories?) 

While defining the goals, its also important to focus on the company’s mission and explain how the goals you have set are aligned to the company’s mission statement.



Important: Mission Statements of Top Tech Companies



Example:

“Facebook’s Goal would be to create the best social media experience for users and allow users to express themselves and engage in the best way possible. Therefore, I would measure the success of Facebook Reactions to improve Engagement on the platform.

Facebook needs users to spend more time on the platform, as an increase in engagement would also lead to an increase in ad revenue for Facebook.”

Note that there can be multiple goals per feature. (e.g., Facebook Stories can drive engagement among users and also generate more revenue.)



4. Describe User Journey

At this step you are expected to give a walkthrough of the user journey from the start to the end of the user interaction with the feature. This would demonstrate your ability to think and understand the different key experiences a user goes through while interacting with the feature or product that might effect the success of the feature.

You can ask the interviewer if they believe you have covered all of the important user journey steps at the end of this step.

(Its always a best practice to keeping the interviewer in the same page at every step of your answer) 



5. Define the Metrics for each step of the User Journey

Once you are done describing the User Journey of the feature / product, its time to define the metrics for each phase in the customer journey. Below is a list of all the customer journey phases a user can go through: (3AE3R )



AwarenessAcquisitionActivationEngagementRetentionMonetization (Revenue)Referral

Awareness

Acquisition

Activation

Engagement

Retention

Monetization (Revenue)

Referral



Some of the above mentioned phases might not be applicable to a particular feature or product you are evaluating. Hence, you will have to select the relevant phases for the feature and come up with metrics for those phases as you walk the interviewer through its user journey.

Example: Let’s say you are asked to measure the Engagement of Facebook Stories. Here since the interviewer has already mentioned the user journey phase (i.e. Engagement) you can directly come up with metrics for that phase.



Think and discuss the relevance of different interactions, behaviours and their results at different user journey phases that can affect the feature goals.Next think about what are the different metrics that would help you measure these user behaviours in each user journey phase.

Think and discuss the relevance of different interactions, behaviours and their results at different user journey phases that can affect the feature goals.

Next think about what are the different metrics that would help you measure these user behaviours in each user journey phase.

Try to come up with at least 3 metrics per relevant customer journey phase. 



Now, let’s look at each phase of the user journey,

The first phase of the user journey is Awareness. Users won't use a feature if they are not aware of its exististance. 

At this step you can define the metrics that would help you measure how users are becoming aware of a feature and their level of awareness. 



Example:

If you are measuring the success of Facebook Stories, it is important to measure the level of awareness of Facebook Stories among Facebook users (i.e. Do users know about Facebook Stories, how they work, and what is the user flow for posting & viewing Facebook Stories ?)

Building products or features to acquire new users into the platform is commonly referred to as Acquisition. It shows the amount of interest among new users, which promotes the development and growth of the feature or product. 

Example:

In the Facebook Stories example, the number of new Facebook Stories users along with % of growth in the number of new users and % of aware users who are acquired can however indicate the success of acquisition for Facebook Stories.



Getting users to onboard into the platform by reducing the initial friction, educating them about the benefits of the product, and gaining their early investment and confidence into the product are all examples of activation goals. A complicated onboarding flows might discourage acquired users from activating their accounts.

Activation and Acquisition can be combined in some cases like in case of Facebook Groups, users are activated as soon as they join a group.

Users engage with products or features when they provide some value or benefits in return. The more users engages with a product the longer they are retained in the platform and the more valuable the user becomes to the platform. 

Hence its important to measure the metrics to track engagement of users with the product.

Example:For Facebook Group, here are a few metrics that one can consider to measure engagement:

% of Facebook Group members who liked a group post.% of Facebook Group members that left comments on Group posts.Average number of Facebook groups a user is a part of.% of users to check their Facebook Group pages in last 30 days.Comparing average user comments on other posts with the average number of comments per Facebook Group post.

% of Facebook Group members who liked a group post.

% of Facebook Group members that left comments on Group posts.

Average number of Facebook groups a user is a part of.

% of users to check their Facebook Group pages in last 30 days.

Comparing average user comments on other posts with the average number of comments per Facebook Group post.





Acquisition of new users into the platform is often expensive hence it becomes crucial to retain the existing users. Retention becomes super important in Ecommerce products like Amazon, Flipkart, Travel website like Priceline, Expedia, and Ride sharing app like Uber, Lyft.Following are some of the retention metrics,

 - % or number of 7 and 30-day active users.

 - % or number of users who made a repeat purchase.



Monetization is also a key metric for a lot of products as it drives the revenue and profitability of the business. For some platforms it may be one of the primary metrics that the company focuses on. (eCommerce websites like Amazon & Flipkart).

There are also certain features where non-monetized goals that make a product or business better. Goals like improve the customer satisfaction, engagement with the core product, the volume of support calls, etc. 

Some of the monetisation metrics to consider are, 

- Average Revenue Per User (Also know as ARPU)- % of converted or paid users, (Also known as conversion % in most cases)- Average spending per time period, - Frequency of purchases per user.- Revenue generated via different sources.

Users will be willing to recommend a product, if they enjoy using it and can derive some benefit from it. Referral is proof of a feature's usfulness and value for the user.

The percentage of consumers who recommend the product or feature, as well as the number of referrals that were converted, are a few metrics that may be used to measure referrals. 

Some metrics that can help measure referrals are,

% or number of users who are referring the product or feature, % or number of converted referrals & ARPU derived from the referred users.

% or number of users who are referring the product or feature, 

% or number of converted referrals & ARPU derived from the referred users.

6. Evaluate and Prioritize the Metrics

After you are done listing down the metrics for each phase of the feature that impacts our goal, it time to prioritise those metrics using the RICE prioritisation framework.

(Check the formula for RICE: reach, impact, confidence, and effort framework here)

The term "Reach" refers to the users who will be exposed to the new feature.“Impact” is a measure of how much of an impact a feature would have on the target users.“Confidence” is a measure of how confident you are in your estimations.“Effort” is the amount of work necessary to measure the metric.

The term "Reach" refers to the users who will be exposed to the new feature.

“Impact” is a measure of how much of an impact a feature would have on the target users.

“Confidence” is a measure of how confident you are in your estimations.

“Effort” is the amount of work necessary to measure the metric.

Based on the above analysis, prioritise your metrics. 

7. Summarize your answer

At the end you need to summarise the whole interview by highlighting the feature goal, key phases you considered and the prioritised list of metrics that you will use to measure the success of the feature.
