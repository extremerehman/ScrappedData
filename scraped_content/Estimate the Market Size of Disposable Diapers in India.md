Interview Tip: Ask Clarifying Questions to understand the scope of the problem.



Q) Are we talking about Baby diapers or Adult diapers or both?

A) Let’s consider, Baby diapers only.







Known: (link)

The population of India - 1.3 Billion

The population of India - 1.3 Billion



Assuming, 60% of them are of childbearing age (18 - 45 age group),

therefore,  60% of 1.3 billion

= 780 million people are of childbearing age.

Approximately, 50% of these (780 million childbearing population) are women,

= 50% of 780 million

= 390 million women

Assuming, 75% of these women have children,

= 75% of 390 million

= 293 million women



Assuming, each women has 1.5 children on average,

 = 1.5 x 293 million

 = 434 million childrens

Assuming, 10% are under the age of 2,

= 434 / 10

~ 44 million (approx)



We can further eliminate ~5%, as people below the poverty level usually don’t use diapers.



Therefore, the market size of disposable diapers is around 42 million (approx).
