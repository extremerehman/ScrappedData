First, clarify with the interviewer which Amazon business you are referring to here. (e.g. Amazon e-commerce, AWS, Music, Prime Videos, etc.) A) For the purpose of this question, assume the Amazon e-commerce platform.

What pain point is it solving for the users?

Amazon is a comprehensive e-commerce platform that serves as a virtual marketplace, offering an extensive selection of products and services to customers across the globe. Through its website and mobile applications, Amazon enables users to browse, purchase, and sell a wide array of items, including electronics, apparel, books, household essentials, and more. Additionally, Amazon provides digital services such as streaming content, cloud computing, and AI-powered virtual assistant devices.

Amazon's mission is to improve the customer experience continually, provide a wide range of products and services, and drive customer satisfaction.

Amazon can be accessed from a desktop web, mobile web, and mobile app (Android, IOS).

Some of Amazon's major competitors include Walmart, Alibaba, eBay, Target, Best Buy, Google (through Google Shopping), Apple (through Apple Store), Shopify.

User Base:

Amazon caters to a diverse user base, ranging from individual consumers to businesses of all sizes. Every day consumers leverage Amazon's platform to conveniently shop for products, compare prices, read customer reviews, and enjoy swift and reliable delivery to their doorstep. Furthermore, businesses, including small-scale sellers and established brands, utilize Amazon as a powerful e-commerce platform to reach a massive customer base, expand their online presence, and benefit from Amazon's fulfilment and logistics services.

How To Use

Users employ Amazon in various ways depending on their needs and preferences. As consumers, they can visit the Amazon website or mobile app, explore different categories, search for specific products, and read detailed product descriptions and customer reviews to make informed purchasing decisions. Customers can also take advantage of features like one-click ordering, personalized recommendations, and hassle-free returns to enhance their shopping experience. On the other hand, businesses utilize Amazon's Seller Central platform to set up their own virtual storefronts, manage inventory, track sales, and leverage marketing tools to reach and engage with customers effectively.

Pain Points it solves for its users:

### Step 2. Ask clarifying questions to narrow the scope. (Q)



Q) What is the goal of improvement here? Improve user engagement? Increase user retention? Increase revenue? Acquire more users and content? Improve the user experience on the App.

A) It’s up to you. You are free to choose.

Q) What is the target audience for these improvements?

A) It’s up to you to decide.

Q) Are we focussing on any particular platform like desktop web/app or mobile web/app?

A) For now, you can just focus on the mobile App.

Q) For the improvement, are we focusing on a Global audience or a specific region?

A) We would be focusing on the Indian audience only.

Q) Why are we thinking about improvements now?

A) Some possible reasons why improvements for Amazon are under consideration are:

1. Evolving Customer Expectations: Customer expectations and preferences are constantly evolving. As technology advances and new trends emerge, customers seek enhanced experiences, faster delivery, improved personalization, and seamless interactions.

### Step 3. Define the Goal you want to achieve. (G)



Amazon's primary goal is to be the most customer-centric company in the world. The company is dedicated to delivering exceptional customer experiences through a wide selection of products, competitive pricing, convenient and reliable delivery, personalized recommendations, and outstanding customer service. Amazon strives to meet and exceed customer expectations, ensuring high levels of satisfaction. Amazon also aims to maintain its market leadership position by continually innovating, expanding its global presence, leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and driving long-term growth and profitability.

However, with the growth of other e-commerce platforms in different geographies like Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, Nykaa, Walmart, Alibaba, eBay, Target, Shopify etc. Amazon is facing tough competition in keeping users engaged and retained on the platform.

Amazon is now a mature product, and I feel improvement in user retention is something that aligns very closely with the mission of Amazon. Also, an increase in user retention will eventually lead to an increase in revenue as well for Amazon.



### Step 4. List the User Segments and choose one segment to focus on. (U)



Broadly, Amazon users can be divided into,

1. Individual Consumers: Amazon serves individual consumers of all ages, demographics, and interests. These users shop for a wide range of products, including electronics, clothing, home goods, books, and more.
2. Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs): Amazon provides a platform for SMBs to sell their products to a global customer base. These sellers range from individual entrepreneurs to small businesses, allowing them to reach a larger market and expand their online presence.
3. Content Creators: Amazon provides platforms for content creators, such as Kindle Direct Publishing for self-publishing authors and Amazon Video Direct for independent filmmakers. These platforms enable content creators to reach a global audience and monetize their work.
