The interviewer is evaluating you on the following:

* Do you talk about feature goals before jumping into defining metrics?
* Is your answer structured or do you tend to talk about random points?
* Do you define metrics precisely or give a general description such as, “I would find out if people used the feature frequently.”

Do you talk about feature goals before jumping into defining metrics?

Is your answer structured or do you tend to talk about random points?

Do you define metrics precisely or give a general description such as, “I would find out if people used the feature frequently.”



## How to structure your answer?



We suggest structuring your answer in the following way:

* Ask clarifying questions to confirm your assumptions (e.g., What does the product do?, Who is the product for? etc.).
* State or confirm with the interviewer what the goal of the product is (e.g., increasing conversion, revenue, profits, sales, engagement, retention, etc.).
* Use the product’s customer lifecycle to drive your analysis of what to measure. For example, think of what to measure at the awareness, engagement, retention, and monetization stages.
* At each stage, identify behaviors that can be defined and quantified with a metric(s). Be detailed and ready to answer how you would gather the data to implement the metric(s).
* Summarize your analysis.
