You work at Facebook in 2017 and we’re considering launching a new platform to compete with Tinder. However, there are 2 key decisions to make,

Choose one platform for launch: iOS app, Android app, Mobile Web, or Desktop Web.

Decide whether the new platform should have its own branding and be standalone from Facebook.com, or integrated.

Here are some aspects that might be relevant:

We’re generally looking for a younger audience that would be single and interested in using this product, but older than 18. Let’s target the 20s-30s.We’re looking for a tech-savvy audience who would be comfortable using technology for dating.We’re seeking a set of users that are geographically close - we want a  close-knit social network of users, instead of users that are spread apart geographically.

Desktop Web - This option we can easily cut. Mobile usage is skyrocketing, and desktop usage as a general trend has been much slower to grow.  Especially among our younger millennial population, the optimal platform must be on mobile.iOS - iOS users are more geographically connected than Android users. iOS users also are more easily monetizable (although as of now, that isn’t an explicit goal). Let’s keep this option.Android - Android is a more international market, and does have advantages in that it provides more “under the hood” to app developers. However, those features are unlikely to be particularly useful here. Additionally, the international market might be too geographically widespread for the initial launch, so we'd probably only launch domestically anyways.Mobile Web - Mobile web has the advantage of targeting both platforms without extra engineering work. However, most users don’t habitually open up websites to view content, and in this case, it’s critical to have push notifications for rapid messaging between users. For this reason, it's not likely that mobile web would be a successful initial platform to target.

Out of the options above, it seems like Android and iOS are the best options. We’ve decided to go with iOS since iOS users are generally affluent, young, and domestically prevalent in the US. We’d push hard on leadership and our engineering team to build an Android app very soon after launch, to fill in the gaps in social circles.



Standalone

Pro: Standalone has the advantage of separate branding - we could develop a  unique brand for our product and attract users irrespective of  Facebook’s brand. Furthermore, Facebook has a lot of users’ personal data - users may feel uncomfortable using Facebook’s platform for dating, since users may not want to mix their friendships and relationships.Con: That said, we’ll be losing a bit of  Facebook’s brand power. We’ll also force users to download a separate app in order to get access to the experience.

Bundled

Pro: A bundled app means easy access, and users who trust Facebook will feel comfortable using the platform. There's an opportunity for synergistic features (for example, perhaps a user's Facebook messages include messages from the dating app product).Con: However, Facebook’s current reputation amongst users for privacy protection is damaged, and especially now it might be important to separate these experiences and be very clear about what information Facebook is storing. Brand-wise, it might also create some issues if some users don't want to use Facebook,  but do want to use the dating app product (or vice versa).

We make the case that the dating app platform should be standalone from Facebook. Some reasons include our average user's desire to have separate platforms for dating and friendship, as well as the benefit of developing a unique, separate brand.

Overall, we’d recommend creating a standalone iOS app experience for the initial launch of the app product, but fast-following with an Android app to complete users’  social circles and ensure access for all in a local community.
