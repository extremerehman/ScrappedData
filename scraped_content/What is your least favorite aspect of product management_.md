Here are some sample answers which you can use,



Taking unnecessary approvals for every decision from the Department Head or other Executives. In some organizations, it is mandatory to take approvals for every small item that is added in the roadmap or even for any changes done to the roadmap items. I feel Product Managers should have some degree of freedom to take their product decisions on their own keeping stakeholders in the loop.Attending unnecessary meetings all day: As a PM I have to attend a lot of meetings with different stakeholders and teams some of which are not directly related to me or my product but takes up a lot of my time which I could use to work on something more productive.Continuous changes to the sprint & roadmap: Ideally there should be a sustainable process that trickles into roadmap development and includes inputs from all relevant stakeholders, leaders, and customers.  This sometimes gets affected due to sudden decisions made by the senior leadership or key stakeholders. An unplanned item usually disturbs the momentum and motivation of the team and wastes a lot of time in context switching.The extensive documentation is something that I’m sure most product managers would prefer to avoid. Of course, it is a vital part of the job and something that I devote attention to, but I really enjoy working with users and developers and hitting deadlines.
