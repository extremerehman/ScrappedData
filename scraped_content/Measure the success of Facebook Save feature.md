Answer:

1. Describe the Product: 



Facebook is a social media platform that allows users to share various aspects of their lives through the use of images, texts, and videos, stay connected with friends and family, and discover, share, and express what is important to them. The platform's mission is to connect people from all over the world and bring them closer together. 

The "Save" feature allows users to save videos, articles, posts, and other types of content for later reading and consumption. Users can create multiple folders or collections, which they can name based on the type of content they are saving. If a user saves any content, it is automatically stored in the "Saved" folder. 

This feature, which is also used for content organization, is helpful for those who may not have time to immediately view a piece of content but wish to do so at a later time.

Users can set the visibility control for each collection, such as making it visible to "Friends," "Contributors only," or "Only me." 

The "Save" feature has been available for a while and has gained widespread adoption. 

Consumers, brands, and individuals who consume a large amount of content are the target market for this feature. If they enjoy a piece of content and want to revisit it in the future, they can use the "Save" feature to bookmark and save it. 

By tracking the content that a user saves, Facebook can understand the types of content a user enjoys and display more relevant, tailored content to the user, improving their overall experience and engagement on the platform.

3. User Goals



The "Save" feature on Facebook is a large part of the Facebook ecosystem and therefore has multiple goals. These goals can range from driving user engagement by encouraging more saves, which indicates that users are liking and interacting more with the content. This, in turn, helps Facebook show more personalized content, improving the user experience. 

Increasing user engagement can also lead to revenue growth for Facebook. While there are multiple goals for this feature, for the purposes of this question, we will consider increasing user engagement as the main goal, as it aligns with Facebook's mission and vision of bringing people closer together from around the world.



4. User Journey



Here is a detailed description of the user journey that drives user engagement on Facebook:

5: Metrics



Discoverability: Here are some metrics that can be used to measure the discoverability of the "Save" feature:The percentage of users who have saved at least one item, indicating that they are aware that they can save items on the platform.The percentage of users who have accessed the "Saved" page at least once, indicating that they know where to find saved items and how to work with them.The percentage of users who have engaged with at least one item in the "Saved" page at least once, showing that they are using the feature to interact with saved content.Adoption: Here are some metrics that can be used to measure the adoption of the "Save" feature:The percentage of users who have engaged with the "Save" feature (such as saving a post, accessing the "Saved" folder, or opening a saved post) in the last 30 days. This shows the frequency with which users are using the feature.The ratio of the number of times a user accesses the "Saved" page to the number of times they visit Facebook in a month. This can give an indication of how central the "Save" feature is to the user's experience on the platform.Engagement:Here are some metrics that can be used to measure the engagement of users with the "Save" feature:The average number of saved posts per user session. This can give an indication of how many posts a user is saving at a time.The average number of views per saved post per user within a 60-day period. This shows the frequency with which users are accessing their saved posts.The average number of monthly page views of the "Saved" page per user. This can indicate how often users are accessing their saved content.The percentage of saved items that users delete without or after engaging with or opening them. This can give an idea of how relevant the saved content is to the user.Comparison of engagement with saved items versus standard news feed items, such as the number of likes, shares, clicks on links, plays of videos, and comments. This can show how users are interacting with saved content compared to other types of content on the platform.Retention: Additional metrics that can be used to measure users' reactions to reminders from Facebook about items in their "Saved" page include:The number of times users click on and engage with items after receiving the reminder. This can show the effectiveness of the reminder in prompting users to interact with their saved content.The change in the number of items that users save each month. This can indicate whether the reminders are leading to an increase or decrease in the amount of content that users are saving.Are we cannibalizing?"Cannibalization" refers to the idea that a new product or feature may negatively impact the performance of an existing product or feature. In the context of the "Save" feature, you can measure whether it is cannibalizing other parts of the Facebook platform by looking at whether there is a decrease or increase in likes, shares, comments, and the number of posts after pre-launching the feature for the test group. If the "Save" feature is cannibalizing other parts of the platform, you might see a decrease in these metrics after launching the feature. On the other hand, if the "Save" feature is not cannibalizing other parts of the platform, you might see an increase in these metrics after launching the feature.User Segmentation: User segmentation can be useful for understanding the demographics of users who engage with the "Save" feature and those who do not. Some demographic factors to consider when segmenting users could include:AgeGenderWhether they use the platform on mobile devices or desktop computersLocationIt can also be useful to consider the type of users who use the "Save" feature most often, such as power users, passive users, or medium users.It may also be a good idea to begin testing the feature with power users to fine-tune it and conduct A/B testing. Power users may be more likely to provide valuable feedback and insights that can help improve the feature.Another metric that could be useful for understanding the use of the "Save" feature is the distribution of the number of items saved in each category, such as text, photos, videos, links, locations, or pages. This can help you understand which categories are most popular among users and whether there is a need to add or remove any categories based on how users are saving content. For example, if a large number of items are being saved in the "Links" category, it may be worth considering adding subcategories or further refining the categories to better organize the saved content. On the other hand, if a particular category is not being used very often, it may be worth considering removing it to simplify the organization of saved content.It is possible that adjusting the news feed of a user based on the items they have saved could lead to an increase in engagement. For example, if the news feed is tailored to recommend new items or give higher priority to items that are similar to the saved items, users may be more likely to like, share, comment on, or interact with these recommended or prioritized items. This could lead to an increase in the number of likes, shares, comments, and posts, as well as an increase in the number of clicks on links, plays of videos, and time spent on the platform. To determine whether this is the case, you could conduct A/B testing by adjusting the news feed for a group of users and measuring the impact on engagement metrics.Monetization: To measure the impact of the "Save" feature on monetization, you could consider the following metrics:The percentage increase in the click-through rate (CTR) for click ads.

6. Evaluate and Prioritize the Metrics

Here are some potential criteria you could use to evaluate and prioritize the metrics for measuring the success of the "Save" feature:

Relevance: Consider whether the metric is directly related to the goals of the "Save" feature, such as increasing user engagement or driving revenue.Actionability: Look at whether the metric is something that can be influenced or improved through changes to the "Save" feature or related elements of the Facebook ecosystem.Data availability: Make sure that the data required to measure the metric is readily available and can be collected in a timely and accurate manner.Complexity: Consider the level of effort required to collect and analyze the data for the metric, as well as the resources required to interpret and act on the results.

Actionability: Look at whether the metric is something that can be influenced or improved through changes to the "Save" feature or related elements of the Facebook ecosystem.

Data availability: Make sure that the data required to measure the metric is readily available and can be collected in a timely and accurate manner.

Complexity: Consider the level of effort required to collect and analyze the data for the metric, as well as the resources required to interpret and act on the results.

Based on these criteria, the metrics of "Avg # Saved posts per user session," "Avg # views per Saved posts per user within a 60-day period," and "Engagement metrics (like, share, comment, time spent, etc.) on saved items versus standard news feed" could be considered high priorities, as they are directly related to the goals of the "Save" feature and can be influenced through changes to the feature. The "% increase in CTR" metric may also be a priority, as it is relevant to the monetization goals of the feature and can be influenced through changes to the ad experience. However, it may be less actionable if the "Save" feature does not directly impact the ad experience.
