Now, that I have all of that answered, I will share the outline of the framework that I will follow to arrive at the root cause,

I will first look at the,

External Factors (Competitor, New Product Launch, etc.), followed byDemographics features ( Impact on any particular demographics customer segment).Next, I would look at the Internal Factors (Tech Release, Design Change or any other Business Decisions, etc.).Next, I will go through the User Journey on the mobile app. (Step by Step journey on the App).

External Factors (Competitor, New Product Launch, etc.), followed by

Demographics features ( Impact on any particular demographics customer segment).

Q) Any incidents and bugs reported from customers on the recent rollout changes?

A) Yes we have seen an increase in reports related to payment since the rollout. 

User Journey in the Mobile App:



Next, we will go through the user journey and see if there is any glitch/bugs in the journey for new users till subscription payment -

→ users download and open the app → user signs up and selects a plan → user lands on the Payment setup page → user selects Debit / Credit card option.→ user fills up all the required details on the Card setup page.→ user clicks on start membership and gets redirected to the payments page to make the payment and activate the subscription.

We checked the flow and found that there is no issue in the App installs and Signups, and user is successfully able to make payments via UPI and successfully able to add all the fields in the Credit/Debit Card payment option and click on ‘Start Subscription’.

If the UPI payments are working, next, I feel we should analyze the ‘Start Subscription’ button which is there in the Credit/Debit Card payment option.

We should check how many customers are clicking on ‘Start Subscription’ and how many users are actually getting redirected to the next payments page (on both android and IOS).

Q) Do we have events data that confirms this flow is getting completed?

A) We are seeing a huge drop in payment start event which gets triggered at the start of the payment funnel for the latest app version.

Hence, the problem is with the Start Subscription button in the latest app version and we should get that flow checked by the tech team.

Also, along with this I would inform the other stakeholder about this drop, the reason for it and expected timeline of fix stopping the rollout of the latest release.

Summary:

So in summary, I would first make sure we can ascertain if the drop was temporary or permanent, gradual or sudden and if the KPI drop may have occurred elsewhere in the user funnel. I would look at internal and external factors, demographics and user flow to try to see if I can pinpoint the issue. Third, if the issue can be fixed immediately, I would contact my team to stop the current release and put out a hotfix. Meanwhile, we should let people in the company know of our findings and keep them updated about our progress.
