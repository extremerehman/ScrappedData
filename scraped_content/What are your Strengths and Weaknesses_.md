This is one of the most common interview questions that most of us experienced or will experience during a Product Manager interview (mostly  in behavioral or HR round) 



When you are asked about your strengths and weaknesses, discuss your weaknesses first so that you can end on a positive note.



Here are some examples of weaknesses:

While mentioning your most significant weaknesses provide examples of how you are attempting to overcome those weaknesses. 





I usually have a tendency of taking up too much stress over small issues which led to health problems. To deal with stress at work as well as personal life, I started bringing changes in my lifestyle (like daily exercise, meditation, taking regular breaks, listening to music). This helped me focus more and increase my patience and productivity at work.I’m naturally shy and an overthinker, which makes it difficult for me to speak up during team meetings. I feel that I have good ideas, but wasn't comfortable speaking up. After I moved to a management role, this became a major issue for me at work and hence I decided to change. I started having conversations with people outside work, made it mandatory to talk to almost everyone about something every day so that I get familiar with them and the environment and could easily express myself in the future.  I can be too critical of myself. I often feel I could have done more even if,  objectively, I’ve done well. Earlier in my career, this led to burnout and negative self-talk. One solution I’ve implemented over the last three years is to actively pause and celebrate my achievements. Not only has this helped my own self-esteem, but it has also helped me genuinely appreciate and recognize my team and other support systems. I  always try to avoid confrontation, in both my personal and professional life. This caused me to compromise sometimes on the quality of my work or what I needed to complete a project just to keep the peace. This became a real problem when I became a manager. One of the most critical aspects of managing people is telling them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear. I recognized this weakness and had been actively working to voice my opinions constructively and helpfully for the betterment of the team.When  I’m given a task, I am very goal-oriented and work hard to complete that task. However, when new projects come across my plate, I sometimes jump right into those projects and halt work on the projects I had in progress. Having to jump between tasks, so many times throughout the day hinders my productivity and prevents me from delivering my best work. I  have been using a project management tool to help me prioritize my tasks and manage my tasks and time.  This has improved my efficiency and productivity.

I’ve always been a natural leader. With over 5 years of product management experience across different industries, I’ve exceeded my KPIs every quarter. I look back at those successes and know that I wouldn’t have reached them if I hadn’t built and led teams composed of highly skilled and diverse individuals. I have the ability to get cross-functional groups on the same page. I’ve regularly honed my management skills through reviews and candid sessions with my team and I know continuing to build my leadership skills is something I want from my next role.My strongest asset is my work ethic and my willingness to step in when needed. I’m not afraid to take on a difficult client or do a project that nobody else wants because those are the clients and projects that teach me the most. I typically love to work outside of my job description and do whatever is asked of me. I'm not above any single task, and I take great pride in my ability to step in and adapt to any situation to get the best results for the company.I’ve always preferred to work in groups and find that my collaborative nature is one of my strongest attributes. On projects that I directed, I  work well to inspire diverse team members and work side by side with them to achieve the project goals. In fact, I’ve increased productivity by ten percent over the course of one year. I’m an empathetic person who is skilled at relating to people and understanding their needs. In one memorable instance from earlier this year, I was on the support line and received a call from a disgruntled customer who had been dropped from our service. While the company couldn’t find a  solution for her, I walked her through other options she might have so she walked away with a positive interaction with the company. I know the importance of a happy customer, and I'm willing to remain upbeat and solutions-oriented.I  believe that my greatest strength is the ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently. I can see any given situation from multiple perspectives, which makes me uniquely qualified to complete my work even under challenging conditions. That problem-solving allows me to be a  better communicator. I am just as comfortable speaking to senior executives as I am junior team members. I think my ability to see all sides of an issue will make me a great asset to the team.
