Behavioral interview questions are about you and your work experience. During the phone screening call with the recruiter, you will be asked questions to evaluate your fit with the job description and your level of interest. Once you pass the recruiter call, the hiring team will ask you questions about your past experience across five different areas: leadership, challenges, successes, failures, and teamwork.

There are three basic questions a recruiter will ask you during a screening call, among others, depending on the company. You need to have strong and succinct answers to all of these three. Here are some frameworks to follow.



1. Tell Me About Yourself



You are making a pitch. Tell a compelling story about why this particular job is the next logical step in your career based on your background, experience, and interests. 

Your answer to this interview question should connect your experience with the job you are applying for. Tell a cohesive story about what you are good at and how you would be an excellent fit for the new role. Your story should provide highlights that would make the interviewer want to ask you for more details. Your pitch should be less than 3 minutes long.

One suggested structure is:

State your career theme (1-2 sentences) — something that summarizes who you are, in a way that is relevant to the product management role you are applying for.Share items from your career that support your theme in chronological or reverse chronological orderWrap up by proving that this job is a logical next step (1-2 sentences) — and include why you are uniquely qualified.
