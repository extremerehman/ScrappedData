Facebook Product Manager Interview Questions



Finally, we come to the most important part of this guide: the interview questions! 

Here we will first describe each type of question in detail, take a look at a few sample questions, and then finally discuss the best way of approaching and answering them. 

Let's jump in! 







As a PM, your primary role is to not only design, create, and launch new products, but also to solve problems with and improve existing products. This is why Product Sense questions are basically aimed at assessing how strong your product design and product strategy skills are. At Facebook especially, these questions are designed to find out if you can turn big, ambiguous, hypothetical problems into a product that will be loved and used by millions of people. 

Within this category, there are a few key skills that Facebook looks for when asking Product Sense questions: 

Your ability to identify who to build for and their needsYour ability to create value and impactHow you break down a problem into smaller, manageable chunksWhether or not you can provide clear, thoughtful reasoningThe intentional design choices you make and why you make them - prioritizing and deciding what to buildHow you handle constraints, new data, and critique

Your ability to identify who to build for and their needs

Your ability to create value and impact

How you break down a problem into smaller, manageable chunks

Whether or not you can provide clear, thoughtful reasoning

The intentional design choices you make and why you make them - prioritizing and deciding what to build

How you handle constraints, new data, and critique

As you can see, Facebook's Product Sense questions are not just meant to assess your creativity, user empathy, and design capabilities, but also your problem-solving, product improvement, and strategy skills. 





Here are a few examples of Product Sense questions that Facebook has asked previously:

If you have to build a new Facebook experience for your phone, what would you build? How would you improve Facebook tagging? How would you make it easier to find new books to read? How would you design an app to help people choose which cheese to buy at a grocery store? How would you improve WhatsApp?

How would you improve Facebook tagging? 

How would you make it easier to find new books to read? 

How would you design an app to help people choose which cheese to buy at a grocery store? 

How would you improve WhatsApp?

As you might have noticed, product sense questions do not only focus on product design and strategy. You can also be asked questions about improving existing products. 





Here is a simplified step-by-step approach that you should apply when answering product sense questions: 

Clarify the scope of the question. This is your chance to clarify the question and narrow down the scope of the exercise. Make sure you understand the interview question and you are clear on what's being asked of you. List user groups and choose. Remember how important people are to Facebook, and share your understanding and identification of the multiple user groups that the product or solution targets. Once you're done listing each relevant user group, choose the one you are targeting and explain why you chose this group. List user needs. Put yourself in the shoes of the people who will be using the product and show that you clearly understand their needs and pain points. Prioritize. Choose which of these needs you are targeting and mention why. List solutions. Provide a list of possible solutions for each need that you are prioritizing. This is where you can showcase your creativity. Evaluate your solutions. This is where you can showcase your evaluation and execution skills by explaining the tradeoffs with each of your solutions and choosing the best one. Describe your solution Help the interviewer visualize your solution by describing in more detail what you'll be building and perhaps providing a wireframe of the user experience. Be prepared to go up to the whiteboard and draw rough wireframes. Facebook interviewers are not just looking to hear you talk about solutions - they want to see you build.

While this is a simplified general technique for most product sense questions, there are many different kinds of questions that can be asked within this category. 

The most important two of these are product design and product improvement questions. To tackle product design and product improvement questions, and all other types of questions, you need to set frameworks that you can rely upon when answering. 

 



As a Facebook PM, while you're designing the product or developing your product strategy, you also have to execute and make the necessary decisions that will get all the correct tasks performed.  That is exactly what the questions in this category are aimed at assessing - how you get things done, deal with problems and turn information into action. 

Before we get into the details here, it is worth mentioning that this is where Facebook distinguishes itself from other companies in the industry. Facebook prides itself on being a data-driven company and thinks about execution in terms of data analytics and data-based decision-making. And they want to know whether or not you have strong analytical skills and can use them to make the decisions needed to get the job done. 

This is how Facebook describes the Execution skills they look for in their PM candidates:

'At Facebook, Product Managers leverage strong critical thinking skills to create logical structures for their team, geared to help guide decisions. Product Managers often have to make difficult prioritization and tradeoff decisions in pursuit of these goals, and adapt their plans as the team executes'

From this, we can see that there are many different types of execution questions Facebook can ask you. Here are three of the most common categories:

Metrics: Your ability to set the right goals for your product and measure themProblem-solving: How you use data to identify, analyze, and debug problems in your productsTrade-off questions: Whether or not you can take two different paths forward into consideration and identify, evaluate and decide on the tradeoffs you need to make for the right decision. 

Metrics: Your ability to set the right goals for your product and measure them

Problem-solving: How you use data to identify, analyze, and debug problems in your products

Trade-off questions: Whether or not you can take two different paths forward into consideration and identify, evaluate and decide on the tradeoffs you need to make for the right decision. 

Before we discuss how to answer these, let's take a look at some examples of questions that Facebook has asked previously.

To help you practice, there are many other Facebook metrics, problem-solving, and tradeoff questions like these available on our interview questions database - all of them posted by people who have gone through the Facebook PM interview process. You can also see how people have answered them, as well as the detailed feedback on those answers provided by experts!





As we have seen, Execution questions can be of many different types, including metrics, problem-solving, and tradeoffs. Let's take a look at simplified step-by-step approaches for answering them. 





Here is a simplified step-by-step breakdown of how you should answer a metrics question. 

Describe the product or feature to showcase your understanding of how it works and the problem it solves.Define the goal that you'd like to focus on.Go over the user journey and talk about the key behaviors that are relevant to the success of the product. List metrics for measuring the user behaviors that you highlighted earlier.Evaluate the metrics you have identified by a set of criteria such as reach or impact. Summarize your answer. Remember to highlight the key metrics you have identified and your evaluation criteria for each.

Identify the problem. The first thing you need to do is identify the problem statement. Sometimes, the interviewer will include it in the question (for example: user retention has dropped) and sometimes they will leave it open-ended and you will have to find it by asking the right set of questions. Present hypothesis. You need to look at all the internal and external factors that may have caused the issue (for example: time, new feature release, seasonality, bugs, bad PR, competition, etc.) to pinpoint the factor that is primarily responsible and where exactly is it that the problem began. Suggest actions. Explain how you suggest to address the problem.

Describe the product or feature in question and ask clarifying questions to make sure you have understood what is being asked of youIdentify the relevant attributes to the decision you have to make. Some examples of attributes are user experience, engagement, and engineering work. Choose a goal that you must keep in mind as you decide which path to take. Discuss the pros and cons of each potential decision - make sure the interviewer knows that you understand and can discuss logically the potential advantages and downsides of each path. Choose a path based on your goal and the results of your evaluation in step 4.

Every company defines their product managers differently. Generally, most companies see their PMs as owners or CEOs of the product - people who are primarily responsible and in charge of their products. 

At Facebook, it's quite different.

Facebook sees its PMs as facilitators and influencers rather than authority figures. Facebook PMs work in collaboration with a range of different experts: software engineers, data scientists, marketing experts, and more. 

It's the PM’s job to not only rally these multi-disciplinary teams to flawlessly design, create and execute solutions but also to keep them motivated, resolve conflicts, nurture relationships and successfully collaborate with other teams across Facebook. 

As a result, this is the part of the interview where you will have to showcase your empathy, drive, leadership skills, and decision-making abilities. Specifically, by asking questions about your past experiences, Facebook looks for evidence that you are someone who:

Takes ownership and build trust among their teamsHas the capability of taking on challenges and setting examples for their teamsIs empathetic and understand the needs of usersIs introspective and has grown/learned from past mistakes and experiencesIs able to rally people around them to pursue specific goals in the face of obstacles and adversityIs supportive of the people around themIs scrappy

While the Product Sense and Execution interviews and questions focus on how good you are at understanding and working on Facebook products, Leadership and Drive questions are primarily concerned with your previous experiences and leadership capabilities.  

There are a lot of questions you can be asked about situations you've been in and the experience and learning you've gained from those. For example: "Tell me about a time when...".
