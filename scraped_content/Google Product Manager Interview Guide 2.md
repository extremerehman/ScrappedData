Google Product Manager Interview Questions



Since you are now familiar with the Google product manager interview and evaluation process, it’s time to take a detailed look at the questions you will be asked. 

In this section, we will first describe each type of question, look at a few example questions, and finally discuss how you should approach and answer them.  





As a Google product manager, your primary tasks will include designing new products and features, as well as improving existing ones. 

This is why product design questions tend to be some of the most asked ones in your interviews. These questions are designed to assess your creativity, user empathy, and design capabilities. 

Here are a few example product design questions that Google has asked previously: 

You are part of the Google Maps team. An autonomous fleet is a reality where autonomous cars are in production and on roads. Uber and Lyft want to show this in Google Maps. How would you design the product?How would you improve Google Maps?How would you design a web search engine for children below 14 years old?What is your favorite product How would you improve it?How would you improve Gmail?

How would you improve Google Maps?

How would you design a web search engine for children below 14 years old?

What is your favorite product How would you improve it?

How would you improve Gmail?

As you can see, product design questions can focus on not only designing new products from scratch but also improving existing Google products. 

Another question Google likes to ask is the 'favorite product' question. This is where they ask you what your favorite product is, along with follow-up questions such as 'where do you feel it's lacking?', or 'how you would improve it?' 

To tackle all of these different types of questions, you need to set frameworks that you can rely upon when answering. 

Luckily, we have various product design question frameworks for you depending on the type of question asked - whether it's product improvement, case use of new technology, or even a favorite product question! 





As a PM, you will be responsible for the entire delivery roadmap for your products. This means that you need to be comfortable in thinking strategically about several key components that make up a successful product strategy. 

These include market relevance, competition, pricing, product timing, and more. 

Here are a few example product strategy questions that Google has asked previously: 

Tell me about a product you think won't be used in the next 3-5 years.  How do you think travel will change?How would you determine if a specific block in your neighborhood is suitable for a new grocery store?Should Google get into the ticketing market? If so then what would you build?Waymo is being asked to monetize beyond the ride-sharing use case, what should they do?Should Facebook consider getting into the Travel industry?How would you launch Facebook's Dating Platform?

Tell me about a product you think won't be used in the next 3-5 years.  

How do you think travel will change?

How would you determine if a specific block in your neighborhood is suitable for a new grocery store?

Should Google get into the ticketing market? If so then what would you build?

Waymo is being asked to monetize beyond the ride-sharing use case, what should they do?

Should Facebook consider getting into the Travel industry?

How would you launch Facebook's Dating Platform?



As you can see from the first two examples, sometimes product strategy questions can be really open-ended. To answer these (and any other kind of question), you need a specific framework that you can use to form your answers. 

The good news is we have frameworks for not only these but all the different kinds of questions you can be asked in your interview. 





Estimation questions are meant to assess your problem-solving and quantitative skills. Google wants to see if you can quickly crunch numbers and calculate estimations such as market size, number of customers, etc. 

Remember, your interviewers will be less interested in whether you got the numbers right or not, and more interested in how you got there in the first place. They want to know how you break the problems down, and how comfortable you are working with estimations like these. 

Here are a few example estimation questions that Google has asked previously: 

How would you estimate the space required for google photos?What is the market for income tax software in the USEstimate the daily watch time of cooking videos on YouTubeHow would you go about finding out the number of red cars in China?Estimate the number of incidents that could be reported by users of Waymo in the SF Bay area.Estimate the Number of ATMs in IndiaEstimate the total number of Airplanes in AirEstimate the Weight of the Empire State BuildingEstimate the Number of WhatsApp Chats occurring in IndiaEstimate the Number of Mobile Phones Sold in India annuallyEstimate the Number of Hours spent on Smart Phones by all IndiansEstimate the Number of Golf balls that can fit in a School BusEstimate Airbnb's RevenueEstimate the Number of Tennis balls you can fit in an AircraftEstimate the Number of Self-Driving Cars

Technical Questions



While PMs are not supposed to be technical gurus like software engineers, you will notice that a typical Google PM is a lot more technical than average. 

Even though you will not be asked a lot of these (typically only one or two), the questions will be centered around your understanding of several technical concepts and whether or not you can explain them in simple terms. 

Here are a few example technical questions that Google has asked previously: 

How would you make the internet work on Mars?When you type something on a browser how does it work?How does the system design for Strava work? How long will I be able to store Stravas data on the phone while offline?Imagine that you are building a budget management system that allows the advertiser to set a daily budget. Design a large-scale distributed system that exhausts the budget but does not overspend.Quantify the number of linear road miles in Google Map.

Here is How to answer technical questions:

Data Analysis Questions



As a PM, it is your job to analyze data to identify, assess, measure, and report different metrics in order to determine the success of your product and prioritize the right set of activities. 

This is why data analytics questions can be broken up into two specific categories: Metrics & Problem Solving.  



These questions will be primarily concerned about what metrics you would choose to track in given situations, or how you would go about investigating changes in a certain metric for a product. 

Here are a few example metrics questions that Google has asked previously: 

What is your favorite app? Define the success metrics for it.How would you measure the success of Google Calendar?How would you measure the success of YouTube TV?There's a 50% drop in the number of Uber rides per day, diagnose the problem.Google Maps had a 10% drop in daily active users. What do you do?How would you evaluate the success of Reactions on Facebook?How would you evaluate the success of Instagram Stories?

What is your favorite app? Define the success metrics for it.

How would you measure the success of Google Calendar?

How would you measure the success of YouTube TV?

There's a 50% drop in the number of Uber rides per day, diagnose the problem.

Google Maps had a 10% drop in daily active users. What do you do?

How would you evaluate the success of Reactions on Facebook?

How would you evaluate the success of Instagram Stories?





As a PM, it is also your responsibility to not only measure and report key metrics but also to act fast and fix issues wherever they occur.

This is why these questions will be geared towards finding out how you would go about investigating and solving a metrics-related problem that has occurred with your product. 

A good example of such a question would be:

"Long-term retention has dropped because of your proposed sign-up changes. What do you do?"









While the behavioral questions aren’t really as difficult compared to others, they’re equally important. 

Questions in this category will be mainly in regard to the following three themes: 

Why do you want to work at Google and as a PM?Your past leadership and team experience, particularly conflict management and working with a diverse group of peopleWhether or not you understand what good PMs do

Why do you want to work at Google and as a PM?
